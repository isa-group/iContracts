(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.  
(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).  
(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:  
(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.

relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.

10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will

however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will

## Document 7: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction
The parties agree that this GitHub Data Protection Agreement (“ **DPA** ”) sets forth their obligations with respect to the processing and security of
Personal Data and, where explicitly stated in the DPA Terms, Customer Data in connection with the Online Services provided by GitHub, Inc. (“ GitHub ”). The DPA (including its Appendix and Attachments) is between GitHub and any customer receiving Online Services from GitHub based on the GitHub Customer Agreement (“ Customer ”), and is incorporated by reference into the GitHub Customer Agreement.  
In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the DPA Terms and any other terms in the GitHub Customer Agreement, the DPA Terms will prevail. The provisions of the DPA Terms supersede any conflicting provisions of the GitHub Privacy Statement that otherwise may apply to processing of Personal Data. For clarity, the Standard Contractual Clauses prevail over any other term of the DPA Terms.

## Document 8: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 9: GitHub Customer Agreement - 8 Pricing and payment
```
8.1 Fees. Customer agrees to pay fees in full, up front and, if invoiced, within thirty (30) days of the invoice
date. Amounts payable are non-refundable, except as stated in this Agreement regarding Product
warranty and third-party claims. If billed based on usage, GitHub will invoice according to the billing
```  
```
model described in the Product documentation.
```
```
8.2 Late payment. If Customer fails to pay fees on time, GitHub has the right to charge 2% monthly interest
on past due amounts as allowed by law. GitHub also has the right to charge Customer for all expenses of
recovery, to terminate the applicable order, turn off access and to take any other action at law.
```
```
8.3 Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except
for taxes based on GitHub’s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, Customer may
deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only if
Customer promptly provides GitHub an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents
reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that
any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.
```

# If the contract is self-renewing can the customer opt out at that time?
## Background
The user is asking about the possibility of opting out of a self-renewing contract, which is a common feature in subscription-based services. In such contracts, the subscription is automatically renewed at the end of each subscription term unless the customer takes action to cancel or opt out of the renewal. The terms and conditions of the contract typically outline the process for opting out of the automatic renewal, including any notice period required and the method for providing notice of the decision not to renew.

## Thoughts
- The user's question pertains to the ability to opt out of a self-renewing contract at the time of renewal. This is a relevant consideration for customers who do not wish to continue their subscription beyond the current term.

  - Helpful: True

- The provided context does not explicitly state that the contract is self-renewing, but the clauses suggest that there are mechanisms in place for both renewal and termination of the subscription.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The answer should clarify whether the customer can opt out at the time of renewal based on the terms outlined in the provided clauses.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes, according to Clause 9.2 of the provided context, the customer can opt out of the contract by providing 30 days' notice. This implies that if the contract is self-renewing, the customer has the option to terminate the agreement without cause by following the notice requirement outlined in the contract terms.
