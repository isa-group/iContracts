## Document 9: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Attachment 2 – International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses
This Addendum has been issued by the Information Commissioner for Parties making Restricted Transfers. The Information Commissioner considers that it provides Appropriate Safeguards for Restricted Transfers when it is entered into as a legally binding contract.

# Are the licenses received by the supplier on the customer's intellectual property limited?
## Background
The user is asking about the scope and limitations of the licenses granted to a supplier by a customer on the customer's intellectual property (IP) within a contractual agreement. This question typically arises in the context of software licensing, where a customer may grant a supplier certain rights to use its IP for specific purposes, such as to provide services or to integrate with the supplier's products. The terms of the license, including any limitations, are usually detailed in the agreement between the customer and the supplier.

## Thoughts
- The user's question pertains to the nature of IP licenses granted to a supplier by a customer. It's relevant to understand the context of the agreement and the specific terms outlined within it to determine the extent of the licenses granted.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- To answer the user's question, we need to refer to the specific clauses in the agreement that outline the scope of the IP licenses granted. Without the actual agreement text, we can only provide a general answer based on typical licensing practices.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question seems to imply that the supplier is receiving licenses on the customer's IP. This is a common scenario in service agreements where the supplier needs to use the customer's IP to perform the contracted services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not provide specific details from the agreement that would indicate the limitations of the IP licenses. Therefore, we must base our response on general principles of IP licensing in contractual agreements.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- In general, licenses received by a supplier on a customer's intellectual property are indeed limited. These limitations are typically defined in the contractual agreement between the customer and the supplier. The license granted is usually nonexclusive, meaning the customer can grant similar licenses to other parties. It is also often limited to certain uses, such as for providing services or integration with the supplier's products, and may be restricted in terms of time, geography, or scope of use. The specific limitations would be detailed in the agreement's terms, and without those details, we can only provide a general overview.
