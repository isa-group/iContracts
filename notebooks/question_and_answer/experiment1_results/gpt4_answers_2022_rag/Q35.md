## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 6 Third party claims
6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.  
6.2 The party being defended must provide the defending party with all requested assistance, information,
and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).  
```
(a) By GitHub. GitHub will defend Customer against any third-party claim that a Product made
available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as provided
by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1)
modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```
```
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its
Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade
secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates
the law or harms a third party.
```

## Document 2: GitHub Customer Agreement - 8 Pricing and payment

date. Amounts payable are non-refundable, except as stated in this Agreement regarding Product
warranty and third-party claims. If billed based on usage, GitHub will invoice according to the billing

on past due amounts as allowed by law. GitHub also has the right to charge Customer for all expenses of
recovery, to terminate the applicable order, turn off access and to take any other action at law.
```
```
8.3 Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except
for taxes based on GitHub’s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, Customer may
deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only if
Customer promptly provides GitHub an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents
reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that
any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.

# To answer the following questions we must simulate a real context. In this case, we consider a customer with an annual subscription, enjoys since January 1, 2024 of the provider's services and the total amount of the fees is 528$. An incident has occurred, what is the provider's responsibility?
## Background
The user question pertains to the liability and responsibility of a service provider, specifically GitHub, in the event of an incident affecting a customer with an annual subscription. The customer has been using the provider's services since January 1, 2024, and the total amount of the fees for the subscription is $528. The user is seeking to understand the extent of GitHub's liability based on the contractual terms outlined in the provided context, which includes various clauses from a service agreement detailing liability limits, defense obligations, exclusions, and exceptions.

## Thoughts
- The user is asking about GitHub's responsibility in the event of an incident. The provided context includes clauses from a service agreement that outline GitHub's liability in such cases.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- To determine GitHub's responsibility, we need to consider the type of incident that occurred and refer to the relevant clauses in the agreement, such as Section 7.1(a) regarding liability limits for products on a subscription basis, and other related sections.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- If the incident is related to a third-party claim of infringement or misappropriation as described in Section 6.1, GitHub's defense obligations would come into play.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- If the incident involves a failure of the product to perform as warranted, the customer's remedies would be as described in Section 5.1.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user has not specified the nature of the incident, which is necessary to accurately determine GitHub's responsibility under the agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Without knowing the specific nature of the incident, we can only provide a general answer based on the liability limits set forth in the agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not require a detailed analysis of all the clauses provided, only those relevant to determining GitHub's liability in the event of an incident.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Based on the provided context, if an incident occurs, GitHub's responsibility will be determined by the nature of the incident and the relevant clauses in the service agreement. For products ordered on a subscription basis, GitHub's maximum liability is limited to the amount the customer paid for the product during the 12 months before the incident, which in this case is $528 (Section 7.1(a)). However, GitHub's liability may be further limited or excluded based on the type of damages (Section 7.1(c)) or if the incident falls under any exceptions (Section 7.1(d)). Without specific details about the incident, it is not possible to provide a precise answer regarding GitHub's responsibility.
