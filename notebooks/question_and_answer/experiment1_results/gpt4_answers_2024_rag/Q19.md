```
```
(c) Exclusions. In no event will either party be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or
consequential damages, or loss of use, loss of profits, or interruption of business; however, caused
or on any theory of liability.
```
```
(d) Exceptions. No limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party’s (1)
confidentiality obligations unrelated to Customer Content; (2) defense obligations above; or (3)
violation of the other party’s intellectual property rights.
```

## Document 1
6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.  
6.2 The party being defended must provide the defending party with all requested assistance, information,
and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the
limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).  
```
(a) By GitHub. GitHub will defend Customer against any third-party claim that a Product made
available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as provided
by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1)
modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```
```
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its
Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade
secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates
the law or harms a third party.

4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 3
1.1 **License grant.** Products are licensed and not sold. Subject to Customer’s compliance with this
Agreement, GitHub grants to Customer a nonexclusive and limited license to install and use the
Products ordered as provided in the applicable Product Specific Terms and this Agreement. The licenses
are only for Customer’s internal business purposes and are non-transferable except as expressly
permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.  
1.2 **Duration of licenses.** Licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed.  
1.3 **Accounts.** Customer may assign each Subscription License to one individual End User for use or access
on any number of devices. Customer may not reassign a Subscription License to another End User
within 90 days of the last assignment, except where End User’s relationship with Customer ends or End
User goes on leave. End User accounts may not be shared by individuals.  
1.4 **End Users.** Customer controls access to and use of the Products by End Users. Customer is responsible
for End Users’ use.  
1.5 **Product Specific Terms.** Product Specific Terms apply to Products such as, but not limited to, GitHub AE,
GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. If there is a conflict between the Product
Specific Terms and the General Terms, the Product Specific Terms apply for that Product.  
1.6 **Previews**. Previews are provided “AS-IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. GitHub may change
or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.  
1.7 **Product changes.** GitHub has the right to make changes to the Products if such changes do not
materially lessen the Product’s functionality. GitHub may provide additional terms that apply to
Customer’s use of updates, new features, or related software.  
1.8 **Affiliates.** Customer’s Affiliates may use the Products under this Agreement. Customer is responsible for
its Affiliates’ use, and Customer has the sole right to enforce this Agreement.

copyright or trademark laws, export control laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in its
jurisdiction.  
1.10 **Reservation of rights.** Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
international treaties. GitHub reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, and no rights
are granted or implied by waiver or estoppel.  
1.11 **Feedback.** Feedback by Customer is optional and voluntary. Feedback may be used by GitHub for
any purpose without obligation of any kind as long as the Customer’s confidential information
remains confidential.  
1.12 **Restrictions.** Unless expressly permitted in this Agreement or by law, Customer may not:  
```
(a) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Product, or try to do so;
```
```
(b) run, upgrade or downgrade, or transfer parts of a Product separately at different times or on
different devices;
(c) install, use, or distribute other software or technology in any way that makes
GitHub’s intellectual property or technology subject to any other license terms;
```
```
(d) work around technical limitations in a Product or restrictions in Product documentation; or
```
```
(e) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute or lend any Products to others, in whole or in part, or host
Products for use by others.
```

applicable SLA during Customer’s use. Customer’s remedies for breach of this warranty are
described in the SLA.
```
```
(b) Software. GitHub warrants that the Software will perform substantially as described in the
applicable Product documentation for one year from the date Customer acquires a license for that

warranty claims not made during the warranty period.
```
5.2 **Exclusions.** The warranties in this Agreement do not apply to problems caused by accident, abuse, or
use inconsistent with this Agreement, including failure to meet minimum system requirements. These
warranties do not apply to Previews.  
5.3 **Disclaimer.** Except for the limited warranties above and subject to applicable law, GitHub provides no
other warranties. It disclaims any other express, implied or statutory warranties, including warranties of
quality, title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.

9.1 Term. This Agreement is effective until terminated by a party, as described below.
```
```
9.2 Termination without cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause on 30 days’
notice. Licenses granted on a subscription basis will continue for the duration of the Subscription Term,
subject to the terms of this Agreement.
```
```
9.3 Termination for cause. Without limiting other remedies, either party may terminate this Agreement for
material breach immediately if the other party fails to cure a curable breach within a 30-day notice
period. Upon such termination:
```
```
(a) All licenses granted under this Agreement will terminate immediately.
```
```
(b) All amounts due under any unpaid invoices will become due and payable immediately.
```
```
(c) If GitHub is in breach, Customer will be reimbursed for any prepaid unused fees.
```
9.4 **Termination for regulatory reasons.** GitHub may modify, discontinue, or terminate a Product in any
country or jurisdiction where there is any current or future government regulation, obligation, or other
requirement, that (1) is not generally applicable to businesses operating there; (2) presents a hardship
for GitHub to continue offering the Product without modification; or (3) causes GitHub to believe these
terms or the Product may conflict with any such regulation, obligation, or requirement. If GitHub
terminates a subscription for regulatory reasons, Customer will receive, as its sole remedy, a
reimbursement for any prepaid, unused subscription fees.  
9.5 **Migration**. Customer may migrate or request migration of the data in its repositories for up to ninety
(90) days after termination of this Agreement. Customer may not use the Products on a production
basis during that time.

## Document 6
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.  
10.8 **No third-party beneficiaries.** This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights except
as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only
during the term of the Agreement.  
10.10 **Notices.** Notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com. If Customer  
```
wishes to formally service notice on GitHub, it must be made through GitHub’s registered agent:
```
```
GitHub, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N

```
Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date
shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier confirmation of delivery.
Notices to Customer will be sent to the individual at the address Customer identifies on its account as
its contact for notices. Customer shall ensure its contact for notices is up to date during each renewal.
GitHub may send notices and other information to Customer by email or other electronic form.
```
10.11 **Applicable law and venue.** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.  
```
If Customer’s principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland,
however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.
```
```
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.
```
```
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.

Affiliates and use contractors to provide certain services. GitHub remains responsible for their
performance.

## Document 7
This GitHub Data Protection Agreement forms part of the GitHub Customer Agreement
between Customer (“You”) and GitHub, Inc., (“GitHub”) covering Your legal entity’s use of the
Online Services. It sets forth the parties’ obligations with respect to Customer Personal Data
processed by GitHub. Capitalized terms not defined in this document shall have the meaning as
provided elsewhere in your GitHub Customer Agreement.

## Document 8
ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). Additional Safeguards Addendum  
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra
safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but
does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.  
**I. Challenges to Orders:** If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal
data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
- **a.** Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
- **b.** Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
- **c.** Challenge the disclosure order legally.  
**II. Indemnification of Data Subjects:** GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages
caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA
government body.  
- **a.** **No Obligation to Indemnify:**
**i.** If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
**ii.** If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.  
- **b.** **Conditions of Indemnification:** Indemnification depends on the data subject proving that:
**i.** GitHub disclosed the data;
**ii.** This led to an official proceeding against them; and
**iii.** The disclosure directly caused damage.  
- **c.** **Scope of Damages:** Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.  
**III. Exercise of Rights:** Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against
GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be
individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.  
**IV. Notice of Change:** GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject
allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a
legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then
suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.  
**V. Termination:** This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved
that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these
additional safeguards.

## Document 9
```
This Agreement consists of the General Terms, the applicable Product Specific Terms and any additional terms

# Is the customer's liability limited?
## Background
The user is asking about the limitation of the customer's liability under a specific agreement, which is likely a contractual document between GitHub and its customer. The provided context includes various sections of the agreement that outline the terms and conditions related to liability, defense obligations, confidentiality, licensing, warranties, termination, and other legal provisions. To answer the user's question, it is necessary to analyze the relevant sections that directly address liability limitations, such as Section 7 ('Limitation of liability') and any other sections that may impact the customer's liability under the agreement.

## Thoughts
- The user's question pertains to whether the customer's liability is limited under the agreement. To answer this, we must look at the specific clauses that define liability limitations.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 7.1 of the agreement outlines the maximum aggregate liability of each party, which is a direct indication of the limitation of the customer's liability. It specifies that GitHub's maximum liability to the customer for any incident is limited to the amount the customer paid for the product during the 12 months before the incident.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 7.1 also includes subsections (a), (b), and (c) which provide specific liability caps for products, previews, and exclusions for certain types of damages. These subsections further clarify the extent of the customer's liability limitations.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 7.1(d) lists exceptions to the liability limitations, indicating circumstances where the limitations or exclusions do not apply. This is relevant because it defines scenarios where the customer's liability may not be limited.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Other sections of the agreement, such as Section 6, which deals with defense obligations, and Section 4, which addresses confidentiality, may indirectly affect the customer's liability but do not directly limit it.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: False

- The user's question is specifically about the customer's liability, not GitHub's. Therefore, while Section 7.1 provides information on GitHub's liability to the customer, it does not explicitly state the customer's liability to GitHub.
  - Flawed: True
  - Helpful: False

- Section 6.1 and 6.2 describe the mutual defense obligations and could imply that the customer's liability is also limited to the extent of providing defense and covering the costs of adverse final judgments or approved settlements, subject to the limitations in Section 7.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The agreement does not appear to contain a section that mirrors Section 7.1 for the customer's liability to GitHub, which suggests that the customer's liability may not be explicitly capped in the same manner as GitHub's liability to the customer.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- The customer's liability under the agreement appears to be limited to certain extents, particularly in the context of mutual defense obligations as outlined in Section 6. However, the agreement does not explicitly state a maximum cap on the customer's liability to GitHub in the same way that it caps GitHub's liability to the customer. Instead, the customer's liability may be inferred to be limited by the responsibilities and obligations they agree to under the terms of the agreement, including defense and indemnification obligations, but without a specified maximum monetary cap.
