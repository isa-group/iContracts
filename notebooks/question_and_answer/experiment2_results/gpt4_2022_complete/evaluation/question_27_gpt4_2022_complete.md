# Evaluation of question Is the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers limited?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No (section 10.1 Independent contracts).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_complete is: No. The customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers is not limited under the GitHub Customer Agreement. The agreement grants a nonexclusive license to the customer (Section 1.1), which implies that the customer retains the freedom to use similar products or services from other suppliers. There are no clauses in the provided sections of the agreement that indicate any restrictions on the customer's business operations or development activities outside of the use of GitHub's products, nor are there any non-compete clauses that would restrict the customer from engaging with other suppliers or developing their own solutions.
