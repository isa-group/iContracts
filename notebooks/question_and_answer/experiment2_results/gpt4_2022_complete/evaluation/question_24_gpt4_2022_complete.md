# Evaluation of question Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Needs to be initiated, according to CA product licenses expire at the end of the subscription period, unless renewed (section 1.2 Duration of licenses).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_complete is: No. The contract renewal is not automatic. According to the GitHub Customer Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement without cause on 30 days' notice. Licenses granted on a subscription basis will continue for the duration of the Subscription Term, subject to the terms of the agreement. This implies that renewal needs to be initiated by the customer and is not automatic.
