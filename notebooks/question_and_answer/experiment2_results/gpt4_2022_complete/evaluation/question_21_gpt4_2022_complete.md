# Evaluation of question If the contract is self-renewing can the customer opt out at that time?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, as a customer may terminate the agreement, but with 30 days' notice (section 9 Term and termination).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_complete is: No. Based on the provided GitHub Customer Agreement, particularly section 9.2, a customer can opt out of the contract by providing termination notice without cause on 30 days' notice. This suggests that if the contract is self-renewing, the customer has the option to terminate the contract before the renewal by adhering to the notice period specified in the agreement. However, the agreement does not explicitly state if it is self-renewing, so it is important to review the contract in full or consult with GitHub directly for confirmation on the renewal process.
## Thoughts
- First, I need to compare the core message of both answers to see if they convey the same meaning.

- The difference lies in the additional context provided by Answer 2 regarding the need to review the contract or consult with GitHub for confirmation on the renewal process.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- This additional context does not change the core message that customers can opt out with notice.

## Assesment
- Match. Justification: Both answers convey the same meaning: customers can opt out of the contract by providing a 30-day notice. While Answer 2 provides additional context about the need to review the contract or consult with GitHub for confirmation on the renewal process, this does not change the core message that customers have the ability to terminate the agreement with notice.
