## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 6 Third party claims
6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.  
6.2 The party being defended must provide the defending party with all requested assistance, information,
and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).  
(a) By GitHub. GitHub will defend Customer against any third-party claim that a Product made available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as provided by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1) modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.  
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates the law or harms a third party.

## Document 2: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;  
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or  
(d) is Feedback.  
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 3: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.  
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.  
10.8 **No third-party beneficiaries.** This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights except
as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only
during the term of the Agreement.  
10.10 **Notices.** Notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com. If Customer  
wishes to formally service notice on GitHub, it must be made through GitHub’s registered agent:  
GitHub, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N
Sacramento, CA 95833- 3505  
Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date
shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier confirmation of delivery.
Notices to Customer will be sent to the individual at the address Customer identifies on its account as
its contact for notices. Customer shall ensure its contact for notices is up to date during each renewal.
GitHub may send notices and other information to Customer by email or other electronic form.  
10.11 **Applicable law and venue.** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.  
If Customer’s principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland,
however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.  
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.  
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.  
10.12 **GitHub Affiliates and contractors.** GitHub may perform its obligations under this Agreement through its
Affiliates and use contractors to provide certain services. GitHub remains responsible for their
performance.  
10.13 **U.S. Public Sector Amendment.** The U.S. Public Sector Amendment applies if you are a Government
Entity, as defined in that amendment.  
10.14 **Government procurement rules.** By accepting this Agreement, Customer represents and warrants that
(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable government procurement laws and regulations;
(2) it is authorized to enter into this Agreement; and (3) this Agreement satisfies all applicable
procurement requirements.

## Document 5: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA)
Additional Safeguards Addendum By this Additional Safeguards Addendum to Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (this “Addendum”), GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) provides additional safeguards to Customer and additional redress to the data subjects to whom Customer’s personal data relates.  
This Addendum supplements and is made part of, but is not in variation or modification of, the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA).  
**1. Challenges to Orders.** In addition to Clause 15.1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), in the event GitHub receives an order from any
third party for compelled disclosure of any personal data that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub shall:  
a. use every reasonable effort to redirect the third party to request data directly from Customer;  
b. promptly notify Customer, unless prohibited under the law applicable to the requesting third party, and, if prohibited from notifying
Customer, use all lawful efforts to obtain the right to waive the prohibition in order to communicate as much information to Customer as
soon as possible; and  
c. use all lawful efforts to challenge the order for disclosure on the basis of any legal deficiencies under the laws of the requesting party or
any relevant conflicts with the law of the European Union or applicable Member State law.  
For purpose of this section, lawful efforts do not include actions that would result in civil or criminal penalty such as contempt of court under the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  
**2. Indemnification of Data Subjects.** Subject to Sections 3 and 4, GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for any material or non-material damage to  
the data subject caused by GitHub’s disclosure of personal data of the data subject that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses
(EU/EEA) in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency (a “Relevant Disclosure”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under this Section 2 to the extent the data subject has already received
compensation for the same damage, whether from GitHub or otherwise.  
**3. Conditions of Indemnification.** Indemnification under Section 2 is conditional upon the data subject establishing, to GitHub’s reasonable satisfaction, that:  
a. GitHub engaged in a Relevant Disclosure;  
b. the Relevant Disclosure was the basis of an official proceeding by the non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency against
the data subject; and  
c. the Relevant Disclosure directly caused the data subject to suffer material or non-material damage.  
The data subject bears the burden of proof with respect to conditions a. though c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under Section 2 if GitHub establishes that the Relevant  
Disclosure did not violate its obligations under Chapter V of the GDPR.  
**4. Scope of Damages.** Indemnification under Section 2 is limited to material and non-material damages as provided in the GDPR and excludes
consequential damages and all other damages not resulting from GitHub’s infringement of the GDPR.  
**5. Exercise of Rights.** Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum may be enforced by the data subject against GitHub irrespective of any  
restriction in Clauses 3 or 12 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). The data subject may only bring a claim under this Addendum on an
individual basis, and not part of a class, collective, group or representative action. Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum are personal
to the data subject and may not be assigned.  
**6. Notice of Change.** In addition to Clause 14 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub agrees and warrants that it has no reason to
believe that the legislation applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which personal data is transferred either by itself or
through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under this Addendum or the
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by this Addendum or the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), it will promptly notify the change to Customer
as soon as it is aware, in which case Customer is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.
**7. Termination.** This Addendum shall automatically terminate if the European Commission, a competent Member State supervisory authority, or an
EU or competent Member State court approves a different lawful transfer mechanism that would be applicable to the data transfers covered by the  
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (and if such mechanism applies only to some of the data transfers, this Addendum will terminate only with
respect to those transfers) and that does not require the additional safeguards set forth in this Addendum.

## Document 6: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction - Applicable DPA Terms and Updates
- Limits on Updates  
When Customer renews or purchases a new subscription to an Online Service, the then-current DPA Terms will apply and will not change during
the term of that new subscription for that Online Service.  
- New Features, Supplements, or Related Software  
Notwithstanding the foregoing limits on updates, when GitHub introduces features, supplements or related software that are new (i.e., that were

features, supplements or related software. If those terms include any material adverse changes to the DPA Terms, GitHub will provide Customer a
choice to use the new features, supplements, or related software, without loss of existing functionality of a generally available Online Service. If
Customer does not use the new features, supplements, or related software, the corresponding new terms will not apply.  
- Government Regulation and Requirements  
Notwithstanding the foregoing limits on updates, GitHub may modify or terminate an Online Service in any country or jurisdiction where there is any current or future government requirement or obligation that (1) subjects GitHub to any regulation or requirement not generally applicable to businesses operating there, (2) presents a hardship for GitHub to continue operating the Online Service without modification, and/or (3) causes. GitHub to believe the DPA Terms or the Online Service may conflict with any such requirement or obligation.

## Document 7: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors
GitHub may hire Subprocessors to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to this engagement and to GitHub
Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by GitHub of the
processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under applicable law, the Standard Contractual Clauses or the GDPR Related Terms.  
GitHub is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with GitHub’s obligations in this DPA. GitHub makes available information about
Subprocessors on the GitHub website https://github.com/subprocessors (or a successor location). When engaging any Subprocessor, GitHub will
ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services GitHub has
retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. GitHub will ensure that Subprocessors
are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of GitHub by the DPA, including the
limitations on disclosure of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to oversee the Subprocessors to ensure that these contractual obligations are met.  
From time to time, GitHub may engage new Subprocessors. GitHub will give Customer notice (by updating the website at https://github.com/github-
subprocessors-list (or a successor location) and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor in
advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data. If GitHub engages a new Subprocessor for a new Online Service, GitHub will give Customer notice prior to availability of that Online Service.  
If Customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Service without penalty
by providing, before the end of the relevant notice period, written notice of termination. Customer may also include an explanation of the grounds
for non-approval together with the termination notice, in order to permit GitHub to re-evaluate any such new Subprocessor based on the applicable
concerns. If the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite.
After termination, GitHub will remove payment obligations for any subscriptions for the terminated Online Service from subsequent invoices to Customer or its reseller.

## Document 15: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Data Security
GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards against accidental or unlawful
destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in
accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with
these measures and safeguards and will continue to take appropriate steps throughout the term of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Appendix A –
Security Safeguards contains a description of the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented by GitHub.  
Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures and security
safeguards for an Online Service meet Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under applicable Data Protection
Requirements. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of the processing of its Customer Data and Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons) the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented and maintained by GitHub provide a
level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Customer Data and Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls.  
GitHub will provide security compliance reporting such as external SOC1, type 2 and SOC2, type2 audit reports upon Customer request. Customer
agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the applicable Data Protection Requirements (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of
the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will otherwise only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report
does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation.  
Should Customer be subject to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation or carry out an audit or investigation in response to a
request by a regulatory or supervisory authority that requires participation from GitHub, and Customers’ obligations cannot reasonably be satisfied
(where allowable by Customer’s regulators) through audit reports, documentation, or compliance information that GitHub makes generally available
to its customers, then GitHub will promptly respond to Customer’s additional instructions and requests for information, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:  
- GitHub will provide access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, and application software.
- Customer and GitHub will mutually agree in a prior written agreement (email is acceptable) upon the scope, timing, duration, control and
evidence requirements, provided that this requirement to agree will not permit GitHub to unreasonably delay its cooperation.
- Customer must ensure its regulator’s use of an independent, accredited third-party audit firm, during regular business hours, with

## Document 18: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
#### Clause 14 Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses  
(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data
importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:  
(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended
onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;  
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such
authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (^3 );  
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.  
(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees
that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.  
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has
become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).  
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these
Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data (^3) As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these
elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies. exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.  
#### Clause 15 Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities  
- 15.1 Notification
(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:  
(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or  
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.  
(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to
use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.  
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).  
(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to  
(c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.  
- 15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation  
(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).  
(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

## Document 20: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - SECTION IV **–** FINAL PROVISIONS
#### Clause 16 Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination  
(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.  
(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).  
(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:  
(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.  
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such noncompliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.  
(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.

(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

8.3 Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except
for taxes based on GitHub’s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, Customer may
deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only if
Customer promptly provides GitHub an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents
reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that
any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.

## Document 33: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ATTACHMENT 3 – EUROPEAN UNION GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION TERMS ATTACHMENT 2 – THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES (UK) Regulation Terms
GitHub makes the commitments in these GDPR Related Terms, to all customers effective May 25, 2018. These commitments are binding upon GitHub with regard to Customer regardless of (1) the version of the GitHub Customer Agreement and DPA that is otherwise applicable to any given Online Services subscription or (2) any other agreement that references this attachment.  
For purposes of these GDPR Related Terms, Customer and GitHub agree that Customer is the controller of Personal Data and GitHub is the processor of such data, except when Customer acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case GitHub is a subprocessor. These GDPR Related Terms apply to the processing of Personal Data, within the scope of the GDPR, by GitHub on behalf of Customer. These GDPR Related Terms do not limit or reduce any data protection commitments GitHub makes to Customer in the GitHub Customer Agreement or other agreement between GitHub and Customer. These GDPR Related Terms do not apply where GitHub is a controller of Personal Data. Relevant GDPR Obligations: Articles 28, 32, and 33  
**1.** GitHub shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of Customer. In the case of general written authorisation, GitHub shall inform Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving Customer the opportunity to object to such changes. (Article 28(2))  
**2.** Processing by GitHub shall be governed by these GDPR Related Terms under European Union (hereafter “Union”) or Member State law and are
binding on GitHub with regard to Customer. The subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type
of Personal Data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the Customer are set forth in the Customer’s licensing agreement, including these GDPR Related Terms. In particular, GitHub shall:  
(a) process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which GitHub is subject; in such a case, GitHub shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;
(b) ensure that persons authorised to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;
(c) take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR;
(d) respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 for engaging another processor;
(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Customer by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Customer’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR;
(f) assist Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the
nature of processing and the information available to GitHub;
(g) at the choice of Customer, delete or return all the Personal Data to Customer after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;
(h) make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Customer or another auditor mandated by Customer. GitHub shall immediately inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. (Article 28(3))  
**3.** Where GitHub engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of Customer, the same data protection obligations as set out in these GDPR Related Terms shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union
or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, GitHub shall remain fully liable to the Customer for the performance of that other processor's obligations. (Article 28(4))  
**4.** Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the
risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Customer and GitHub shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:
(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;
(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring
the security of the processing. (Article 32(1))
**5.** In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed (Article 32(2)).  
**6.** Customer and GitHub shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of Customer or GitHub who has access to Personal Data does not process them except on instructions from Customer, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law (Article 32(4)).  
**7.** GitHub shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach (Article 33(2)). Such notification will include that information a processor must provide to a controller under Article 33(3) to the extent such information is reasonably available to GitHub.

## Document 34: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Data Retention and Deletion
Upon Customer's reasonable request, unless prohibited by law, GitHub will return or destroy all Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services at all locations where it is stored within 30 days of the request, provided that it is no longer needed for providing the Online Services or the purposes for which a data subject had authorized the processing of their Personal Data. GitHub may retain Customer Data or Personal Data to the extent required by the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law, and only to the extent and for such period as required by the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law, provided that GitHub will ensure that the Customer Data or Personal Data is processed only as necessary for the purpose specified in the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law and no other purpose, and the Customer Data or Personal Data remains protected by the Applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law.

## Document 35: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ATTACHMENT 1 – THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES (EU/EEA) Controller to Processor - SECTION II **–** OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
#### Clause 8 Data protection safeguards  
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.  
8.1 Instructions
(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of
the contract.
(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.  
8.2 Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.  
8. 3 Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  
8.4 Accuracy  
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.  
8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data  
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).  
8.6 Security of processing  
(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data,
including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter
‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.  
(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.  
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.  
(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to
notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.  
8.7 Sensitive data  
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.  
8.8 Onward transfers  
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (^1 ) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:  
(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;  
(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;  
(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or  
(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.  
8.9 Documentation and compliance  
(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.  
(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data
exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.  
(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data
importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.  
(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.  
#### Clause 9 Use of sub-processors  
(a) GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data
importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 90 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.  
(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data
subjects. (^2 ) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor
complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.  
(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a subprocessor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent
necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.  
(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data
importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.  
(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law
or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the subprocessor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data (^2) This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in
accordance with Clause 7.  
#### Clause 10 Data subject rights  
(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised
to do so by the data exporter.  
(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In
this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall
be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.  
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.  
#### Clause 11 Redress  
(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle
complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.  
(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a
timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.  
(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:  
(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;  
(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.  
(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.  
(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.  
(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable
laws.  
#### Clause 12 Liability  
(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.  
(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under
these Clauses.  
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material
damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU)
2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.  
(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from
the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.  
(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally
liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.  
(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.  
(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.  
#### Clause 13 Supervision  
(a) [Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with
these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.

## Document 46: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Processing of Personal Data; GDPR
All Personal Data processed by GitHub in connection with the Online Services is obtained as part of either Customer Data, Professional Services Data (including Support Data), Diagnostic Data, or Service Generated Data. Personal Data provided to GitHub by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Online Service is also Customer Data. Pseudonymized identifiers may be included in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data and are also Personal Data. Any Personal Data pseudonymized, or de-identified but not anonymized, or Personal Data derived from Personal Data is also Personal Data.  
To the extent GitHub is a processor or subprocessor of Personal Data subject to the GDPR, the GDPR Related Terms in Attachment 3 govern that processing and the parties also agree to the following terms in this sub-section (“Processing of Personal Data; GDPR”):  
- Processor and Controller Roles and Responsibilities  
Customer and GitHub agree that Customer is the controller of Personal Data and GitHub is the processor of such data, except (a) when Customer
acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case GitHub is a subprocessor; or (b) as stated otherwise in the GitHub Customer Agreement or this
DPA. When GitHub acts as the processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, it will process Personal Data only on Customer’s behalf and in
accordance with documented instructions from Customer. Customer agrees that its GitHub Customer Agreement (including the DPA Terms and
any applicable updates), along with the product documentation and Customer’s use and configuration of features in the Online Services, are
Customer’s complete documented instructions to GitHub for the processing of Personal Data. Information on use and configuration of the Online
Services can be found at https://docs.github.com or a successor location. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed to according to
the process for amending Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement. In any instance where the GDPR applies and Customer is a processor, Customer
warrants to GitHub that Customer’s instructions, including appointment of GitHub as a processor or subprocessor, have been authorized by the
relevant controller.  
To the extent GitHub uses or otherwise processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer, GitHub will comply with the obligations of an independent data controller under GDPR for such use. GitHub is accepting the added responsibilities of a data “controller” under the GDPR for processing in connection with its legitimate business operations to: (a) act consistent with regulatory requirements, to the extent required under the GDPR; and (b) provide increased transparency to Customers and confirm GitHub’s accountability for such processing. GitHub employs safeguards to protect Personal Data in processing, including those identified in this DPA and those contemplated in Article 6(4) of the GDPR. With respect to processing of Personal Data under this paragraph, GitHub makes the commitments set forth in the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in Attachment 1 or Attachment 2 (as applicable); for those purposes, (i) any GitHub disclosure of Personal Data, as described in Annex IV to Attachment 1, that has been transferred in connection with GitHub’s legitimate business operations is deemed a “Relevant Disclosure” and (ii) the commitments in Annex IV to Attachment 1 apply to such Personal Data.  
- Processing Details  
The parties acknowledge and agree that:  
- Subject Matter. The subject-matter of the processing is limited to Personal Data within the scope of the section of this DPA entitled “Nature
of Data Processing; Ownership” above and the GDPR.
- Duration of the Processing. The duration of the processing shall be in accordance with Customer instructions and the terms of the DPA.
- Nature and Purpose of the Processing. The nature and purpose of the processing shall be to provide the Online Service pursuant to
Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement and for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Service to
Customer (as further described in the section of this DPA entitled “Nature of Data Processing; Ownership” above).
- Categories of Data. The types of Personal Data processed by GitHub when providing the Online Service include: (i) Personal Data that
Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data); and (ii) those
expressly identified in Article 4 of the GDPR that may be contained in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data. The types of Personal Data
that Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data) may be any
categories of Personal Data identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including
the categories of Personal Data set forth in Annex I to Attachment 1.
- Data Subjects. The categories of data subjects are Customer’s representatives and end users, such as employees, contractors, collaborators,
and customers, and may include any other categories of data subjects as identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller
pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including the categories of data subjects set forth in Annex I to Attachment 1.  
- Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests  
GitHub will make available to Customer, in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Online Service and GitHub’s role as a processor of
Personal Data of data subjects, the ability to fulfill data subject requests to exercise their rights under the GDPR. If GitHub receives a request from
Customer’s data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR in connection with an Online Service for which GitHub is a data
processor or subprocessor, GitHub will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to Customer. Customer will be responsible for
responding to any such request including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Online Service. GitHub shall comply with reasonable
requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request.  
- Records of Processing Activities  
To the extent the GDPR requires GitHub to collect and maintain records of certain information relating to Customer, Customer will, where
requested, supply such information to GitHub and keep it accurate and up-to-date. GitHub may make any such information available to the
supervisory authority if required by the GDPR.

# Is the customer's ability to confront the supplier or any other party limited?
## Background
The user is asking about the limitations on the customer's ability to confront the supplier or any other party, which likely refers to the customer's legal rights and remedies in the event of a dispute or issue with the supplier's products or services. This question is typically addressed in the terms and conditions of a contract or agreement between the customer and the supplier, where clauses related to dispute resolution, liability, indemnification, and third-party claims outline the processes and limitations for addressing conflicts.

In the context of the GitHub Customer Agreement and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement, there are specific sections that deal with liability, indemnification, third-party claims, and dispute resolution. These sections define the extent of each party's responsibilities and the procedures for handling claims and disputes. For instance, limitations on liability may cap the amount a party can recover in damages, while indemnification clauses may require one party to compensate the other for certain types of losses. Additionally, the agreements may specify the legal venues and jurisdictions for resolving disputes, as well as any mandatory arbitration procedures.

To answer the user's question accurately, it is necessary to examine the relevant sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement that discuss the customer's rights and any restrictions on their ability to confront the supplier or other parties.
