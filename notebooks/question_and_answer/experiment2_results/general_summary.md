# Conclusions of the result

In this document, we will compare the results of the questions that the GPT-4 model had difficulty solving with each strategy.  The determination of "Match" or "No Match" comes from the final manual evaluation, based on the review of the comparisons made by the GPT-4. For this, we contrast the answers generated by GPT-4 and those obtained manually, and verify the accuracy of the subsequent validation performed by GPT-4. At the end, we labelled each response according to a previously established guide.


 Question | GPT-4 2024 complete | GPT-4 2024 rag | GPT-4 2022 complete | GPT-4 2022 rag | justification
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q9, Q10, Q13, Q17, Q20, Q21, Q22, Q25, Q27, Q28, Q29 | ✅ GPT-4 correct| ✅ GPT-4 correct| ✅ GPT-4 correct  |✅ GPT-4 correct||
|Q8 | ✅ GPT-4 correct | ✅ GPT-4 hallucinations | ✅ GPT-4 correct | ✅ GPT-4 correct | It does not discuss ownership of customer data. In full 2024, the model is able to find a section where it mentions customer content and rights. In 2022 rag, the DPA document is the same as manual and the answers match. In 2024 rag, it hallucinates and talks about the client's rights on GitHub services. |
|Q11 | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ✅ GPT-4 hallucinations | ✅ GPT-4 correct | GPT-4 talks about the licenses that the client receives on GitHub's intellectual property, not the other way around. |
|Q12 | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | The provider is obliged to delete personal information after the end of the contract. The question is not as specific as it should be. |
|Q14 | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | The limitation of liability focuses on certain situations in which the Customer does not have to become involved in third party claims. The agreement specifies situations in which the customer must be involved and those in which it must not, but there is no monetary limitation on those in which it must be involved. |
|Q15 | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ✅ Human Misinterpretation | Although the agreement does not explicitly limit the customer's ability to confront, the clauses mentioned by GPT-4 could collectively impose implicit limitations. |
|Q16 | ✅ GPT-4 correct | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ✅ GPT-4 correct | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | First it said no, but the explanation is correct in 2024 rag and 2022 rag |
|Q18 | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation |  ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | No limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party’s (3) violation of the other party’s intellectual property rights |
|Q19 | ✅ GPT-4 hallucinations | ✅ GPT-4 hallucinations |  ✅ GPT-4 correct | ✅ GPT-4 correct | In the first two strategies, GPT-4 modifies the agreement at its discretion. In the latter, it can be inferred that the client's liability is limited by the liabilities and obligations it accepts under the terms of the agreement, including defence and indemnification obligations, but without a specified maximum monetary cap. Therefore, it is a bit ambiguous for both parties |
|Q23 | ✅ GPT-4 correct  | ❌ RAG-omision | ✅ GPT-4 correct | ❌ RAG-omision | The rag technique omit important information for this question. |
|Q24 | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation |❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | ❌ GPT-4 Misinterpretation | GPT-4 mentions that the Customer Agreement indicates uncertainty about the renewal process. |
|Q26 | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation | ❌ Human Misinterpretation| There is information to infer that it is in the united states, especially in 2022 ANNEX I A. LIST OF PARTIES. |
