or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.

## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in

assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and

```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver

as expressly provided by its terms.

however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction

jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.

is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement

modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and

# As a customer, can I modify the source code of the product or service to my liking?
## Background
The user is asking about the possibility of modifying the source code of a product or service provided by GitHub. This question pertains to the rights and limitations set forth in the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically regarding the use of GitHub's products and services. The relevant sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement that may address this question include the license grant (1.1), restrictions (1.12), and the reservation of rights (1.10).

## Thoughts
- The user's question is about modifying the source code, which is likely covered under the license grant and restrictions sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.1 of the GitHub Customer Agreement grants a nonexclusive and limited license to use the products, which implies that there may be limitations on the modification of the source code.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.12 of the GitHub Customer Agreement lists specific restrictions on what a customer can do with the product, including prohibitions on reverse engineering and working around technical limitations.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.10 of the GitHub Customer Agreement reserves all rights not expressly granted in the agreement, which may include the right to modify the source code.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's ability to modify the source code will depend on the specific terms of the license granted by GitHub and any restrictions or reservations of rights.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- No. Section(s): 1 License to use GitHub Products. Justification: As a customer, you cannot modify the source code of the product or service to your liking. According to Section 1.12 of the GitHub Customer Agreement, customers are prohibited from reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any Product, or trying to do so. Additionally, Section 1.10 reserves all rights not expressly granted in the agreement, which likely includes the right to modify the source code. Therefore, the license granted is limited and does not allow for such modifications.
