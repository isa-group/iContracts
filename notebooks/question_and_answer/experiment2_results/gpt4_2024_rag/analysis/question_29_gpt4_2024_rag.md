10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.

new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.

General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in

relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.

# Can the customer notify the supplier via email?
## Background
The user is asking whether a customer can notify the supplier via email. This question is likely in the context of the GitHub Customer Agreement and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement, which outline the methods by which notices can be provided to GitHub (the supplier in this context).

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement provide specific instructions on how notices should be sent to GitHub.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- According to the GitHub Data Protection Agreement section 14, notices to GitHub can be provided by contacting customer support or using GitHub's Privacy web form, with copies emailed to GitHub's Data Protection Officer and mailed to GitHub's Privacy address.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Customer Agreement section 10.10 also states that notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com, with formal service notice made through GitHub's registered agent.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not specify which type of notice they are referring to, which could be relevant as different types of notices might have different requirements.
  - Flawed: True
  - Helpful: False

- Since the user's question is general and does not specify the type of notice, it is reasonable to assume that they are asking about the general process of notifying GitHub, which is outlined in the agreements.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Data Protection Agreement - 14. Notices & GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous. Justification: Yes, the customer can notify the supplier (GitHub) via email. According to the GitHub Data Protection Agreement section 14, notices to GitHub can be provided by contacting customer support or using GitHub's Privacy web form, with copies emailed to GitHub's Data Protection Officer.
