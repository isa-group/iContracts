## Document 1: DPA Attachment 2 - A. TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA
Description of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data
importer(s) (including any relevant certifications) to ensure an appropriate level of security,
taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons  
1. Data Security Certifications. Data importer holds the following data security
certifications as applicable:
- SOC 1, Type 2;
- SOC 2, Type 2; and,
- ISO 27001:2013.
2. Personnel. Data importer’s personnel will not process personal data without
authorization. Personnel are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any such
personal data and this obligation continues even after their engagement ends.
3. Data Privacy Contact. The data privacy officer of the data importer can be reached at
dpo@github.com and the following address: GitHub, Inc. Attn: Privacy, 88 Colin P.
Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, California 94107 USA
4. Technical and Organization Measures. GitHub implements and maintains the technical
and organizational measures and security safeguards listed in Table 1 below for
processing Customer Personal Data on behalf and in accordance with Customer
Instructions in connection with the Online Services. These measures in conjunction with
the security commitments in this DPA are GitHub’s only responsibility with respect to
the security of that data.
5. Vendor management program - third-party risk program. The data importer has a
vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection
agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use
case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data
importer’s vendors’ risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or
processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements,
undergo reassessment annually.

## Document 5: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```

Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 6: DPA Attachment 4
ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). Additional Safeguards Addendum  
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra
safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but
does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.  
**I. Challenges to Orders:** If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal
data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
- **a.** Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
- **b.** Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
- **c.** Challenge the disclosure order legally.  
**II. Indemnification of Data Subjects:** GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages
caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA
government body.  
- **a.** **No Obligation to Indemnify:**
**i.** If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
**ii.** If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.  
- **b.** **Conditions of Indemnification:** Indemnification depends on the data subject proving that:
**i.** GitHub disclosed the data;
**ii.** This led to an official proceeding against them; and
**iii.** The disclosure directly caused damage.  
- **c.** **Scope of Damages:** Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.  
**III. Exercise of Rights:** Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against
GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be
individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.  
**IV. Notice of Change:** GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject
allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a
legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then
suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.  
**V. Termination:** This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved
that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these
additional safeguards.

## Document 7: DPA Attachment 2 - A. TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA - Asset Management

Services, it may extract personal data and data importer will delete personal data, each in
accordance with the DPA terms applicable to the agreement.  
_For transfers to (sub-) processors, also specify subject matter, nature and duration of the
processing:_  
In accordance with the DPA, the data importer may hire other companies to provide limited
services on data importer’s behalf, such as providing customer support. Any such
subcontractors will be permitted to obtain personal data only to deliver the services the data
importer has retained them to provide, and they are prohibited from using personal data for
any other purpose. Unless a particular subcontractor is replaced ahead of time, the processing
will be for the term designated under the applicable GitHub Customer Agreement between
data exporter and data importer.

# Does the customer retain ownership of the data he provides to the supplier?
## Background
The user question pertains to the ownership of data provided by a customer to a supplier, in the context of a service agreement or similar arrangement. Ownership of data is a critical aspect of data protection and privacy laws, as it determines who has the legal right to control and make decisions regarding the use, distribution, and deletion of the data. In many service agreements, particularly those involving cloud services or software as a service (SaaS), the terms regarding data ownership are outlined in the customer agreement or data protection addendum (DPA). These documents typically specify the rights and responsibilities of both the customer (data controller) and the supplier (data processor) with respect to the data provided by the customer.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement and Data Protection Agreement (DPA) likely contain clauses that address the ownership of data provided by the customer.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The specific sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement and DPA that may be relevant to data ownership include the sections on licenses, data protection, and confidentiality.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The term 'ownership' may not be explicitly used, but the rights and responsibilities regarding the data will be indicative of who maintains control over the data.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user question does not specify the context of 'supplier,' but given the provided context, it is assumed to refer to GitHub as the supplier of services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The answer to the user question should be based on the interpretation of the relevant sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement and DPA.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 1 License to use GitHub Products. Justification: Yes, the customer retains ownership of the data they provide to GitHub, the supplier. This is indicated in the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically in section 1.1, which states that the licenses granted are for the customer's internal business purposes and are non-transferable except as expressly permitted under the agreement. While the term 'ownership' is not explicitly used, the agreement implies that the customer maintains control over their data, as they are the ones granting GitHub a limited license to use the data as part of the service.
