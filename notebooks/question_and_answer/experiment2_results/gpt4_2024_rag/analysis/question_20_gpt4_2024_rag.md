notice. Licenses granted on a subscription basis will continue for the duration of the Subscription Term,
subject to the terms of this Agreement.
```
```
9.3 Termination for cause. Without limiting other remedies, either party may terminate this Agreement for material breach immediately if the other party fails to cure a curable breach within a 30-day notice period. Upon such termination:

9.4 **Termination for regulatory reasons.** GitHub may modify, discontinue, or terminate a Product in any country or jurisdiction where there is any current or future government regulation, obligation, or other requirement, that (1) is not generally applicable to businesses operating there; (2) presents a hardship for GitHub to continue offering the Product without modification; or (3) causes GitHub to believe these terms or the Product may conflict with any such regulation, obligation, or requirement. If GitHub terminates a subscription for regulatory reasons, Customer will receive, as its sole remedy, a reimbursement for any prepaid, unused subscription fees.  
9.5 **Migration**. Customer may migrate or request migration of the data in its repositories for up to ninety (90) days after termination of this Agreement. Customer may not use the Products on a production basis during that time.

for End Users’ use.

Specific Terms and the General Terms, the Product Specific Terms apply for that Product.

or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.  
1.7 **Product changes.** GitHub has the right to make changes to the Products if such changes do not
materially lessen the Product’s functionality. GitHub may provide additional terms that apply to
Customer’s use of updates, new features, or related software.

its Affiliates’ use, and Customer has the sole right to enforce this Agreement.

```
```
(b) run, upgrade or downgrade, or transfer parts of a Product separately at different times or on
different devices;
(c) install, use, or distribute other software or technology in any way that makes
GitHub’s intellectual property or technology subject to any other license terms;
```

## Document 2: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.  
10.8 **No third-party beneficiaries.** This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights except
as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only
during the term of the Agreement.  
10.10 **Notices.** Notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com. If Customer  
```
wishes to formally service notice on GitHub, it must be made through GitHub’s registered agent:
```
```
GitHub, Inc.

2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N

```
Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date
shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier confirmation of delivery.
Notices to Customer will be sent to the individual at the address Customer identifies on its account as
its contact for notices. Customer shall ensure its contact for notices is up to date during each renewal.
GitHub may send notices and other information to Customer by email or other electronic form.
```

laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.  
```
If Customer’s principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland,
however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.
```
```
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.
```
```
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.

## Document 3: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 4: GitHub Customer Agreement - 7 Limitation of liability

# Does the customer have any right to terminate the agreement?
## Background
The GitHub Customer Agreement outlines the terms under which GitHub provides its products and services to customers. This agreement includes provisions for the term and termination of the agreement, which specify the conditions under which either GitHub or the customer can terminate the agreement. The relevant sections that discuss termination rights include Section 9, which details the term and termination conditions, and Section 1, which discusses the license to use GitHub products.

## Thoughts
- The customer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause on 30 days' notice as per Section 9.2 of the GitHub Customer Agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The customer can also terminate the agreement for cause if GitHub fails to cure a curable breach within a 30-day notice period, according to Section 9.3.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- If the customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, they may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Services without penalty as stated in Section 9 of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 9 Term and termination. Justification: Yes, the customer has the right to terminate the agreement. They can do so without cause on 30 days' notice as per Section 9.2, for cause if GitHub fails to cure a breach within a 30-day notice period as per Section 9.3, and they may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Services without penalty if they do not approve of a new Subprocessor as per Section 9 of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement.
