## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 8 Pricing and payment
```
8.1 Fees. Customer agrees to pay fees in full, up front and, if invoiced, within thirty (30) days of the invoice
date. Amounts payable are non-refundable, except as stated in this Agreement regarding Product
warranty and third-party claims. If billed based on usage, GitHub will invoice according to the billing
```  
```
model described in the Product documentation.
```
```
8.2 Late payment. If Customer fails to pay fees on time, GitHub has the right to charge 2% monthly interest
on past due amounts as allowed by law. GitHub also has the right to charge Customer for all expenses of
recovery, to terminate the applicable order, turn off access and to take any other action at law.
```
```
8.3 Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except
for taxes based on GitHub’s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, Customer may
deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only if
Customer promptly provides GitHub an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents
reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that
any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.
```

## Document 2: GitHub Customer Agreement - 6 Third party claims
6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.  
6.2 The party being defended must provide the defending party with all requested assistance, information,
and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).  
```
(a) By GitHub. GitHub will defend Customer against any third-party claim that a Product made
available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as provided
by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1)
modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```
```
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its
Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade
secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates
the law or harms a third party.
```

## Document 3: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

for End Users’ use.  
1.5 **Product Specific Terms.** Product Specific Terms apply to Products such as, but not limited to, GitHub AE,

Specific Terms and the General Terms, the Product Specific Terms apply for that Product.

or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.  
1.7 **Product changes.** GitHub has the right to make changes to the Products if such changes do not
materially lessen the Product’s functionality. GitHub may provide additional terms that apply to
Customer’s use of updates, new features, or related software.  
1.8 **Affiliates.** Customer’s Affiliates may use the Products under this Agreement. Customer is responsible for
its Affiliates’ use, and Customer has the sole right to enforce this Agreement.

copyright or trademark laws, export control laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in its

international treaties. GitHub reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, and no rights
are granted or implied by waiver or estoppel.

any purpose without obligation of any kind as long as the Customer’s confidential information
remains confidential.  
1.12 **Restrictions.** Unless expressly permitted in this Agreement or by law, Customer may not:  
```
(a) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Product, or try to do so;
```
```
(b) run, upgrade or downgrade, or transfer parts of a Product separately at different times or on
different devices;
(c) install, use, or distribute other software or technology in any way that makes
GitHub’s intellectual property or technology subject to any other license terms;
```
```
(d) work around technical limitations in a Product or restrictions in Product documentation; or
```
```
(e) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute or lend any Products to others, in whole or in part, or host

## Document 5: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.

as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only
during the term of the Agreement.  
10.10 **Notices.** Notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com. If Customer  
```
wishes to formally service notice on GitHub, it must be made through GitHub’s registered agent:
```
```
GitHub, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N

```
Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date
shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier confirmation of delivery.
Notices to Customer will be sent to the individual at the address Customer identifies on its account as
its contact for notices. Customer shall ensure its contact for notices is up to date during each renewal.
GitHub may send notices and other information to Customer by email or other electronic form.
```
10.11 **Applicable law and venue.** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.  
```
If Customer’s principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland,
however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.
```
```
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.
```
```
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.

## Document 6: DPA Attachment 4
ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). Additional Safeguards Addendum  
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra
safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but
does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.  
**I. Challenges to Orders:** If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal
data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
- **a.** Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
- **b.** Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
- **c.** Challenge the disclosure order legally.  
**II. Indemnification of Data Subjects:** GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages
caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA
government body.  
- **a.** **No Obligation to Indemnify:**
**i.** If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
**ii.** If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.  
- **b.** **Conditions of Indemnification:** Indemnification depends on the data subject proving that:
**i.** GitHub disclosed the data;
**ii.** This led to an official proceeding against them; and
**iii.** The disclosure directly caused damage.  
- **c.** **Scope of Damages:** Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.  
**III. Exercise of Rights:** Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against
GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be
individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.  
**IV. Notice of Change:** GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject
allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a
legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then
suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.  
**V. Termination:** This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved
that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these
additional safeguards.

## Document 7: GitHub Data Protection Agreement - 2. Scope and Order of Precedence.
- **A.** This DPA applies to all Online Services except:
* i. Products specifically identified as excluded in bespoke GitHub product terms, in which case those terms shall control so long as such terms are compliant with Data Protection Requirements, and
* ii. Previews, which may employ privacy and security measures that are different from those normally provided in Online Services and offered under Preview Terms. Unless otherwise noted, Customers should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.
- **B.** In the event of any other conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this DPA Terms and any other terms in the GitHub Customer Agreement, the terms of this DPA shall prevail. The terms of this DPA shall supersede any conflicting provisions with respect to the processing of Customer Personal Data or Professional Services Data.

## Document 8: GitHub Data Protection Agreement - 10. CCPA.
If and to the extent GitHub is processing Personal Data within the scope of the CCPA on Your behalf and in accordance with Your documented Instructions, GitHub will not:
- **A.** sell the Personal Data as the term “selling” is defined in the CCPA;
- **B.** share, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer, or otherwise communicate orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, the Personal Data to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including transactions for cross-context behavioral advertising in which no money is exchanged;
- **C.** retain, use, or disclose the Personal Data for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in this DPA and the GitHub Customer Agreement, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA;
- **D.** retain, use, or disclose the Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship with Customer; or
- **E.** combine the Personal Data with personal information that it receives from or on behalf of a third party or collects from California residents, except that GitHub may combine Personal Data to perform any business purpose as permitted by the CCPA or any regulations adopted or issued under the CCPA.
