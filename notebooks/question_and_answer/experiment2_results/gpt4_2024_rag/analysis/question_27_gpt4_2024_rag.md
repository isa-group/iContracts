is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.

and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.

by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is

modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```

secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates
the law or harms a third party.

10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.

new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly

General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and

Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in

assignment without required approval will be void.

```

relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver

as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only

be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.

however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.
```
```
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.
```

The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.

## Document 6: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 7: GitHub Customer Agreement - 2 Support

someone other than a GitHub Representative modifies the Products or (c) Customer uses the Products in a
manner unauthorized by the Agreement or Product documentation.

# Is the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers limited?
## Background
The user question pertains to whether the GitHub Customer Agreement restricts the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers. This question can be addressed by examining the terms of the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically looking for clauses that might limit the customer's freedom to engage with other suppliers or develop their own competing products or services. The relevant sections to consider would be those related to license grants, restrictions, intellectual property rights, confidentiality, and any other clauses that might implicitly or explicitly impose limitations on the customer's business activities outside of their use of GitHub's products.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement grants a nonexclusive and limited license to use GitHub products, which implies that the customer is not restricted from using other similar products or services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.12 of the GitHub Customer Agreement explicitly states that the customer may not work around technical limitations in a Product or restrictions in Product documentation, but this does not necessarily limit the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 10.1 of the GitHub Customer Agreement states that the parties are independent contractors, which suggests that the customer retains the freedom to engage in business with other parties and develop their own products.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- There are no sections in the GitHub Customer Agreement that explicitly restrict the customer from developing or procuring similar products or services from other suppliers.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Customer Agreement's focus is on the use, access, and distribution of GitHub's own products and services, rather than on limiting the customer's business activities with other suppliers or their own product development.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 1 License to use GitHub Products, GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous. Justification: No, the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers is not limited by the GitHub Customer Agreement. The agreement grants a nonexclusive license, which does not restrict the customer from using other similar products or services. Additionally, Section 10.1 establishes that the parties are independent contractors, implying that the customer has the freedom to engage with other suppliers or develop their own products. There are no clauses in the agreement that explicitly restrict the customer's business activities outside of their use of GitHub's products.
