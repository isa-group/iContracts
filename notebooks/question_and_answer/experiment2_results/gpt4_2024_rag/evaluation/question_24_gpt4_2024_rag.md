# Evaluation of question Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Needs to be initiated, according to CA product licenses expire at the end of the subscription period, unless renewed (section 1.2 Duration of licenses).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: No. The contract renewal process is not explicitly stated as automatic in the provided sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Section 9.2 indicates that either party may terminate the Agreement without cause on 30 days' notice, suggesting that action is required to terminate rather than to renew. However, for a definitive answer on the renewal process, the customer should review the Product Specific Terms and the Order process, as these documents might contain specific details on renewal not covered in the provided sections.
