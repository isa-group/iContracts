# Evaluation of question Does the customer retain ownership of the data he provides to the supplier?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, because the customer retains all rights, title and interest and GitHub may only use the customer's data for what is strictly necessary (Data Protection Document, Nature of Data Processing and Ownership and Processing for GitHub's legitimate business operations sections).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: Yes. Yes, the customer retains ownership of the data they provide to GitHub, the supplier. This is indicated in the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically in section 1.1, which states that the licenses granted are for the customer's internal business purposes and are non-transferable except as expressly permitted under the agreement. While the term 'ownership' is not explicitly used, the agreement implies that the customer maintains control over their data, as they are the ones granting GitHub a limited license to use the data as part of the service.
