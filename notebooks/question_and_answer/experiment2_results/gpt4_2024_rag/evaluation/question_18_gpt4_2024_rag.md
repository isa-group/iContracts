# Evaluation of question If the supplier indemnifies for infringement of third party intellectual property, is it exempt from the limit of liability?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, as infringement of IP rights is an exception to limitation of liability and liability is limited to direct damages respectively (section 7 Limitation of liability).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: No. No, the supplier indemnifying for infringement of third party intellectual property is not exempt from the limit of liability. According to Section 7(d) 'Exceptions' of the GitHub Customer Agreement, no limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party's violation of the other party's intellectual property rights. This means that while GitHub does have an obligation to defend and potentially indemnify the customer against third-party intellectual property infringement claims as outlined in Section 6, this indemnification is not exempt from the limitations of liability established in Section 7.
