# Evaluation of question Are the customer's indemnification obligations limited in third party claims?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No, since the parties mutually defend each other and will contribute the amount of any final judgment (section 6 Third party claims).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: Yes. Yes, the customer's indemnification obligations are limited in third-party claims as outlined in the GitHub Customer Agreement. Specifically, Section 6.3 indicates that the indemnification provisions are the sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 ('Limitation of liability'). Additionally, Section 7.1(d) clarifies that no limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party's defense obligations, which are part of the indemnification process.
