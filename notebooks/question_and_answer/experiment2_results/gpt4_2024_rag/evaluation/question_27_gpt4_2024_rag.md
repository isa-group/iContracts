# Evaluation of question Is the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers limited?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No (section 10.1 Independent contracts).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: No. No, the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers is not limited by the GitHub Customer Agreement. The agreement grants a nonexclusive license, which does not restrict the customer from using other similar products or services. Additionally, Section 10.1 establishes that the parties are independent contractors, implying that the customer has the freedom to engage with other suppliers or develop their own products. There are no clauses in the agreement that explicitly restrict the customer's business activities outside of their use of GitHub's products.
