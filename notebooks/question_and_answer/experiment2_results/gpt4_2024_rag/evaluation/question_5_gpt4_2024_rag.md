# Evaluation of question As a customer, can I modify the source code of the product or service to my liking?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No, as the customer may neither distribute the product to third parties nor upgrade parts of the product respectively (section 1.12 Restrictions).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_rag is: No. As a customer, you cannot modify the source code of the product or service to your liking. According to Section 1.12 of the GitHub Customer Agreement, customers are prohibited from reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any Product, or trying to do so. Additionally, Section 1.10 reserves all rights not expressly granted in the agreement, which likely includes the right to modify the source code. Therefore, the license granted is limited and does not allow for such modifications.
