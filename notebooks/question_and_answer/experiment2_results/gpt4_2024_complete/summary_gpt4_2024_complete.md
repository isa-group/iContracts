- **GPT-4 answer:** "Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 11 Definitions. Justification: Yes, the customer retains ownership of the data they provide to the supplier. This is supported by the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically in the 'Definitions' section, where 'Customer Content' is defined as content that the customer creates, owns, or to which the customer holds the rights. The agreement does not transfer ownership of such content to GitHub, indicating that the customer retains ownership of the data they provide."

Justification: Yes, the rights of use that GitHub receives over the customer's data are limited to what is strictly necessary for providing the service. This is outlined in Section 3 of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement, which specifies the processing roles and responsibilities. GitHub acts as a data processor and processes customer personal data according to the customer's instructions and for the purposes outlined in the agreement. Additionally, when GitHub acts as an independent data controller, the purposes for which it may process customer personal data are limited to specific, enumerated purposes, ensuring that GitHub's rights over customer data are confined to what is necessary for the provision of the service."

- **GPT-4 answer:** "No. Section(s): License grant. Justification: The licenses received by the customer on GitHub's intellectual property are limited, as outlined in Section 1.1 of the GitHub Customer Agreement. However, the GitHub Customer Agreement does not grant licenses on the customer's intellectual property. Instead, it grants a nonexclusive and limited license to install and use GitHub's products for the customer's internal business purposes, subject to compliance with the agreement. The customer's intellectual property rights are not licensed to GitHub under this agreement."
  - Score: 10

Evaluation
- **GPT-4:** Match. Justification: Both answers ultimately convey that the licenses received by the supplier (GitHub) on the customer's intellectual property are limited.

- **GPT-4 answer:** "No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 7 Limitation of liability. Justification: No, the supplier's indemnification for infringement of third-party intellectual property is not exempt from the limit of liability. According to Section 7(d) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, no limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party's violation of the other party's intellectual property rights. This means that while GitHub does indemnify the customer against third-party intellectual property claims as per Section 6, this indemnification is subject to the exceptions to the limitations of liability outlined in Section 7(d)."
