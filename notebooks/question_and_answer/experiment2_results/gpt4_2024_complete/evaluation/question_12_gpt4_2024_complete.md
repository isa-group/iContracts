# Evaluation of question Does the supplier have to delete personal information after the end of the contract?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No, because customer data is only destroyed at the customer's request and if lawful (data protection document, Data Retention and Deletion section).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_complete is: Yes. Yes, the supplier, in this case GitHub, is obligated to delete personal information after the end of the contract. This is specified in the GitHub Data Protection Agreement under section 8, titled 'Retention and Deletion,' which states that GitHub will delete or return all Customer Personal Data following the completion of the services, unless prohibited by law.
