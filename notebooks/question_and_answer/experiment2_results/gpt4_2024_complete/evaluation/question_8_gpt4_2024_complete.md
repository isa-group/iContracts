# Evaluation of question Does the customer retain ownership of the data he provides to the supplier?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, because the customer retains all rights, title and interest and GitHub may only use the customer's data for what is strictly necessary (Data Protection Document, Nature of Data Processing and Ownership and Processing for GitHub's legitimate business operations sections).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_complete is: Yes. Yes, the customer retains ownership of the data they provide to the supplier.

The agreement does not transfer ownership of such content to GitHub, indicating that the customer retains ownership of the data they provide.
