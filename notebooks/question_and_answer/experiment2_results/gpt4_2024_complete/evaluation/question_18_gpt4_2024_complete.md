According to Section 7(d) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, no limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party's violation of the other party's intellectual property rights. This means that while GitHub does indemnify the customer against third-party intellectual property claims as per Section 6, this indemnification is subject to the exceptions to the limitations of liability outlined in Section 7(d).
