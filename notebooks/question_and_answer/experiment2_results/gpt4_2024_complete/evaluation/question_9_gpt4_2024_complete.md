# Evaluation of question Are the rights of use the supplier receives over the customer's data limited to what is strictly necessary?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, because the customer retains all rights, title and interest and GitHub may only use the customer's data for what is strictly necessary (Data Protection Document, Nature of Data Processing and Ownership and Processing for GitHub's legitimate business operations sections).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_complete is: Yes. Yes, the rights of use that GitHub receives over the customer's data are limited to what is strictly necessary for providing the service. This is outlined in Section 3 of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement, which specifies the processing roles and responsibilities. GitHub acts as a data processor and processes customer personal data according to the customer's instructions and for the purposes outlined in the agreement. Additionally, when GitHub acts as an independent data controller, the purposes for which it may process customer personal data are limited to specific, enumerated purposes, ensuring that GitHub's rights over customer data are confined to what is necessary for the provision of the service.
