If taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, the customer may deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, provided that the customer promptly supplies GitHub with an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund.
