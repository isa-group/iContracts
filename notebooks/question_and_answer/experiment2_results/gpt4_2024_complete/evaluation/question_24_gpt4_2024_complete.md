# Evaluation of question Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Needs to be initiated, according to CA product licenses expire at the end of the subscription period, unless renewed (section 1.2 Duration of licenses).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2024_complete is: No. The contract renewal process for the GitHub Customer Agreement is not explicitly stated as either automatic or customer-initiated in the provided excerpts. Section 9 of the GitHub Customer Agreement, which covers 'Term and Termination,' does not mention automatic renewal or the need for customer initiation for contract renewal. Further review of the GitHub Customer Agreement or additional documentation may be necessary to determine the specific renewal process.
