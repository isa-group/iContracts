### Q24. Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?

Analysis

- **GPT-4 answer:** No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 9 Term and termination & GitHub Customer Agreement - 1 License to use GitHub Products. Justification: The contract renewal for the GitHub Customer Agreement is not explicitly stated as automatic within the provided sections. Section 1.2 indicates that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed, which suggests that renewal requires action. However, without a specific clause stating the renewal process, it cannot be definitively said whether the renewal is automatic or needs to be initiated by the customer. Therefore, based on the available information, the renewal process is not clearly defined as automatic.
