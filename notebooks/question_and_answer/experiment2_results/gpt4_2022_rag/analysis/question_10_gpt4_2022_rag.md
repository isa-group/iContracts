## Document 0: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - GENERAL TERMS
- Compliance with Laws  
GitHub will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision of the Online Services, including security breach notification law and Data
Protection Requirements. However, GitHub is not responsible for compliance with any laws or regulations applicable to Customer or Customer’s
industry that are not generally applicable to information technology service providers. GitHub does not determine whether Customer Data includes
information subject to any specific law or regulation. All Security Incidents are subject to the Security Incident Notification terms below.  
Customer must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its use of Online Services, including laws related to biometric data, confidentiality
of communications, and Data Protection Requirements. Customer is responsible for determining whether the Online Services are appropriate for
storage and processing of information subject to any specific law or regulation and for using the Online Services in a manner consistent with
Customer’s legal and regulatory obligations. Customer is responsible for responding to any request from a third party regarding Customer’s use of
an Online Service, such as a request to take down content under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other applicable laws.

## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 2: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Data Security
GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards against accidental or unlawful
destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in
accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with
these measures and safeguards and will continue to take appropriate steps throughout the term of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Appendix A –
Security Safeguards contains a description of the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented by GitHub.  
Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures and security
safeguards for an Online Service meet Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under applicable Data Protection
Requirements. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of the processing of its Customer Data and Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons) the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented and maintained by GitHub provide a
level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Customer Data and Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls.  
GitHub will provide security compliance reporting such as external SOC1, type 2 and SOC2, type2 audit reports upon Customer request. Customer
agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the applicable Data Protection Requirements (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of
the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will otherwise only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report
does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation.  
Should Customer be subject to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation or carry out an audit or investigation in response to a
request by a regulatory or supervisory authority that requires participation from GitHub, and Customers’ obligations cannot reasonably be satisfied
(where allowable by Customer’s regulators) through audit reports, documentation, or compliance information that GitHub makes generally available
to its customers, then GitHub will promptly respond to Customer’s additional instructions and requests for information, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:  
- GitHub will provide access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, and application software.
- Customer and GitHub will mutually agree in a prior written agreement (email is acceptable) upon the scope, timing, duration, control and
evidence requirements, provided that this requirement to agree will not permit GitHub to unreasonably delay its cooperation.
- Customer must ensure its regulator’s use of an independent, accredited third-party audit firm, during regular business hours, with
reasonable advance written notice to GitHub, and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Neither Customer, its regulators, nor
its regulators’ delegates shall have access to any data from GitHub’s other customers or to GitHub systems or facilities not involved in the Online Services.
- Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer, including all reasonable
costs and fees for any and all time GitHub expends, in addition to the rates for services performed by GitHub.
- If the report generated from GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer includes any findings pertaining to GitHub, Customer will share such report, findings, and recommended actions with GitHub where allowed by Customer’s regulators.

Description of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data importer(s) (including any relevant certifications) to ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.  
1. Data Security Certifications. Data importer holds the following data security certifications:
- SOC 1, Type 2;
- SOC 2, Type 2;
- NIST, to the extent incorporated for FedRAMP Low-Impact / Tailored ATO.
2. Personnel. Data importer’s personnel will not process personal data without authorization. Personnel are
obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any such personal data and this obligation continues even after
their engagement ends.
3. Data Privacy Contact. The data privacy officer of the data importer can be reached at the following
address:  
```
GitHub, Inc.
Attn: Privacy
88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street
San Francisco, California 94107 USA

4. Technical and Organization Measures. The data importer has implemented and will maintain appropriate
technical and organizational measures, internal controls, and information security routines intended to
protect personal data, as defined in the Security Practices and Policies section of the DPA, against
accidental loss, destruction, or alteration; unauthorized disclosure or access; or unlawful destruction as
follows: The technical and organizational measures, internal controls, and information security routines
set forth in the Data Security section of the DPA are hereby incorporated into this Annex II to
Attachment 1 by this reference and are binding on the data importer as if they were set forth in this Annex 2
to Attachment 1 in their entirety.

Vendor management program - third-party risk program The data importer has a vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data importer’s vendors' risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.  
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements, undergo reassessment annually.

# Does the provider commit to any security standards or practices regarding customer content?
## Background
The user is asking about the commitment of the provider, in this case, GitHub, to security standards or practices in relation to customer content. This question is relevant to users who want to ensure that their data is handled securely and in compliance with certain standards when using GitHub's services. The GitHub Data Protection Agreement and the GitHub Customer Agreement outline the provider's commitments to data security and the protection of customer content.

## Thoughts
