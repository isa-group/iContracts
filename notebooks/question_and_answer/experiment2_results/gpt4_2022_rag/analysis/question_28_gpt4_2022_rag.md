## Document 1: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX I to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) - C. COMPETENT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY
Identify the competent supervisory authority/ies in accordance with Clause 13:  
The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

## Document 2: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Data Security
GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards against accidental or unlawful
destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in
accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with
these measures and safeguards and will continue to take appropriate steps throughout the term of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Appendix A –
Security Safeguards contains a description of the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented by GitHub.  
Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures and security
safeguards for an Online Service meet Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under applicable Data Protection
Requirements. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of the processing of its Customer Data and Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons) the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented and maintained by GitHub provide a
level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Customer Data and Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls.  
GitHub will provide security compliance reporting such as external SOC1, type 2 and SOC2, type2 audit reports upon Customer request. Customer
agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the applicable Data Protection Requirements (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of
the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will otherwise only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report
does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation.  
Should Customer be subject to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation or carry out an audit or investigation in response to a
request by a regulatory or supervisory authority that requires participation from GitHub, and Customers’ obligations cannot reasonably be satisfied
(where allowable by Customer’s regulators) through audit reports, documentation, or compliance information that GitHub makes generally available
to its customers, then GitHub will promptly respond to Customer’s additional instructions and requests for information, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:  
- GitHub will provide access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, and application software.
- Customer and GitHub will mutually agree in a prior written agreement (email is acceptable) upon the scope, timing, duration, control and
evidence requirements, provided that this requirement to agree will not permit GitHub to unreasonably delay its cooperation.
- Customer must ensure its regulator’s use of an independent, accredited third-party audit firm, during regular business hours, with
reasonable advance written notice to GitHub, and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Neither Customer, its regulators, nor
its regulators’ delegates shall have access to any data from GitHub’s other customers or to GitHub systems or facilities not involved in the Online Services.
- Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer, including all reasonable
costs and fees for any and all time GitHub expends, in addition to the rates for services performed by GitHub.
- If the report generated from GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer includes any findings pertaining to GitHub, Customer will share such report, findings, and recommended actions with GitHub where allowed by Customer’s regulators.

## Document 3: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - GENERAL TERMS
- Compliance with Laws  
GitHub will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision of the Online Services, including security breach notification law and Data
Protection Requirements. However, GitHub is not responsible for compliance with any laws or regulations applicable to Customer or Customer’s
industry that are not generally applicable to information technology service providers. GitHub does not determine whether Customer Data includes
information subject to any specific law or regulation. All Security Incidents are subject to the Security Incident Notification terms below.  
Customer must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its use of Online Services, including laws related to biometric data, confidentiality
of communications, and Data Protection Requirements. Customer is responsible for determining whether the Online Services are appropriate for
storage and processing of information subject to any specific law or regulation and for using the Online Services in a manner consistent with
Customer’s legal and regulatory obligations. Customer is responsible for responding to any request from a third party regarding Customer’s use of
an Online Service, such as a request to take down content under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other applicable laws.

## Document 5: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Processing of Personal Data; GDPR
All Personal Data processed by GitHub in connection with the Online Services is obtained as part of either Customer Data, Professional Services Data (including Support Data), Diagnostic Data, or Service Generated Data. Personal Data provided to GitHub by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Online Service is also Customer Data. Pseudonymized identifiers may be included in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data and are also Personal Data. Any Personal Data pseudonymized, or de-identified but not anonymized, or Personal Data derived from Personal Data is also Personal Data.  
To the extent GitHub is a processor or subprocessor of Personal Data subject to the GDPR, the GDPR Related Terms in Attachment 3 govern that processing and the parties also agree to the following terms in this sub-section (“Processing of Personal Data; GDPR”):  
- Processor and Controller Roles and Responsibilities  
Customer and GitHub agree that Customer is the controller of Personal Data and GitHub is the processor of such data, except (a) when Customer
acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case GitHub is a subprocessor; or (b) as stated otherwise in the GitHub Customer Agreement or this
DPA. When GitHub acts as the processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, it will process Personal Data only on Customer’s behalf and in
accordance with documented instructions from Customer. Customer agrees that its GitHub Customer Agreement (including the DPA Terms and
any applicable updates), along with the product documentation and Customer’s use and configuration of features in the Online Services, are
Customer’s complete documented instructions to GitHub for the processing of Personal Data. Information on use and configuration of the Online
Services can be found at https://docs.github.com or a successor location. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed to according to
the process for amending Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement. In any instance where the GDPR applies and Customer is a processor, Customer
warrants to GitHub that Customer’s instructions, including appointment of GitHub as a processor or subprocessor, have been authorized by the
relevant controller.  
To the extent GitHub uses or otherwise processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer, GitHub will comply with the obligations of an independent data controller under GDPR for such use. GitHub is accepting the added responsibilities of a data “controller” under the GDPR for processing in connection with its legitimate business operations to: (a) act consistent with regulatory requirements, to the extent required under the GDPR; and (b) provide increased transparency to Customers and confirm GitHub’s accountability for such processing. GitHub employs safeguards to protect Personal Data in processing, including those identified in this DPA and those contemplated in Article 6(4) of the GDPR. With respect to processing of Personal Data under this paragraph, GitHub makes the commitments set forth in the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in Attachment 1 or Attachment 2 (as applicable); for those purposes, (i) any GitHub disclosure of Personal Data, as described in Annex IV to Attachment 1, that has been transferred in connection with GitHub’s legitimate business operations is deemed a “Relevant Disclosure” and (ii) the commitments in Annex IV to Attachment 1 apply to such Personal Data.  
- Processing Details  
The parties acknowledge and agree that:  
- Subject Matter. The subject-matter of the processing is limited to Personal Data within the scope of the section of this DPA entitled “Nature
of Data Processing; Ownership” above and the GDPR.
- Duration of the Processing. The duration of the processing shall be in accordance with Customer instructions and the terms of the DPA.
- Nature and Purpose of the Processing. The nature and purpose of the processing shall be to provide the Online Service pursuant to
Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement and for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Service to
Customer (as further described in the section of this DPA entitled “Nature of Data Processing; Ownership” above).
- Categories of Data. The types of Personal Data processed by GitHub when providing the Online Service include: (i) Personal Data that
Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data); and (ii) those
expressly identified in Article 4 of the GDPR that may be contained in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data. The types of Personal Data
that Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data) may be any
categories of Personal Data identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including
the categories of Personal Data set forth in Annex I to Attachment 1.
- Data Subjects. The categories of data subjects are Customer’s representatives and end users, such as employees, contractors, collaborators,
and customers, and may include any other categories of data subjects as identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller
pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including the categories of data subjects set forth in Annex I to Attachment 1.  
- Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests  
GitHub will make available to Customer, in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Online Service and GitHub’s role as a processor of
Personal Data of data subjects, the ability to fulfill data subject requests to exercise their rights under the GDPR. If GitHub receives a request from
Customer’s data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR in connection with an Online Service for which GitHub is a data
processor or subprocessor, GitHub will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to Customer. Customer will be responsible for
responding to any such request including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Online Service. GitHub shall comply with reasonable
requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request.  
- Records of Processing Activities  
To the extent the GDPR requires GitHub to collect and maintain records of certain information relating to Customer, Customer will, where
requested, supply such information to GitHub and keep it accurate and up-to-date. GitHub may make any such information available to the
supervisory authority if required by the GDPR.

## Document 6: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Processor Confidentiality Commitment
GitHub will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of Customer Data and Personal Data on behalf of Customer in connection with the Online Services (i) will process such data only on instructions from Customer or as described in this DPA, and (ii) will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of such data even after their engagement ends. GitHub shall provide periodic and mandatory data privacy and security training and awareness to its employees with access to Customer Data and Personal Data in accordance with applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law and industry standards.
