## Document 4: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Nature of Data Processing; Ownership
Except as otherwise stated in the DPA Terms, GitHub will use and otherwise process Customer Data and Personal Data as described and subject to
the limitations provided below (a) to provide Customer the Online Service in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions, and/or (b) for
GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer. As between the parties, Customer retains all right,
title and interest in and to Customer Data. GitHub acquires no rights in Customer Data other than the rights Customer grants to GitHub in this section.
This paragraph does not affect GitHub’s rights in software or services GitHub licenses to Customer.  
- Processing to Provide Customer the Online Services  
For purposes of this DPA, “to provide” an Online Service consists of:  
- Delivering functional capabilities as licensed, configured, and used by Customer and its users, including providing personalized user
experiences;
- Troubleshooting (e.g., preventing, detecting, and repairing problems); and
- Ongoing improvement (e.g., installing the latest updates and making improvements to user productivity, reliability, efficacy, and security).  
When providing Online Services, GitHub will use or otherwise process Personal Data only on Customer’s behalf and in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions.  
- Processing for GitHub’s Legitimate Business Operations  
For purposes of this DPA, “GitHub’s legitimate business operations” consist of the following, each as incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer: (1) billing and account management; (2) compensation (e.g., calculating employee commissions and partner incentives); (3) internal reporting and business modeling (e.g., forecasting, revenue, capacity planning, product strategy); (4) combatting fraud, abuse, cybercrime, or cyber-attacks that may affect GitHub or Online Services; (5) improving the core functionality of accessibility, privacy or energy-efficiency; (6) financial reporting and compliance with legal obligations (subject to the limitations on disclosure of Processed Data outlined below); (7) the creation or management of end user accounts and profiles by GitHub for individual users of Customer (except where Customer creates, manages or otherwise controls such end user accounts or profiles itself); and (8) other purposes pertaining to Personal Data not provided by Customer for storage in GitHub repositories or in connection with Professional Services.

## Document 5: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors
GitHub may hire Subprocessors to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to this engagement and to GitHub
Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by GitHub of the
processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under applicable law, the Standard Contractual Clauses or the GDPR Related Terms.  
GitHub is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with GitHub’s obligations in this DPA. GitHub makes available information about
Subprocessors on the GitHub website https://github.com/subprocessors (or a successor location). When engaging any Subprocessor, GitHub will
ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services GitHub has
retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. GitHub will ensure that Subprocessors
are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of GitHub by the DPA, including the
limitations on disclosure of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to oversee the Subprocessors to ensure that these contractual obligations are met.  
From time to time, GitHub may engage new Subprocessors. GitHub will give Customer notice (by updating the website at https://github.com/github-
subprocessors-list (or a successor location) and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor in
advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data. If GitHub engages a new Subprocessor for a new Online Service, GitHub will give Customer notice prior to availability of that Online Service.  
If Customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Service without penalty
by providing, before the end of the relevant notice period, written notice of termination. Customer may also include an explanation of the grounds
for non-approval together with the termination notice, in order to permit GitHub to re-evaluate any such new Subprocessor based on the applicable
concerns. If the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite.
After termination, GitHub will remove payment obligations for any subscriptions for the terminated Online Service from subsequent invoices to Customer or its reseller.

4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,

if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

# Is the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers limited?
## Background
The user question pertains to whether the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers is limited under the GitHub Customer Agreement. The relevant sections of the agreement that could potentially limit such abilities would typically be those related to license grants, intellectual property rights, confidentiality, and non-compete clauses, if any. The GitHub Customer Agreement provides terms and conditions under which GitHub's products and services are offered to customers, including the scope of the license, restrictions on use, and the customer's responsibilities regarding the use of GitHub's products and services.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the customer is prohibited from developing or procuring similar products or services from other suppliers.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 10.1 of the GitHub Customer Agreement states that the parties are independent contractors and may develop products independently without using the other's Confidential Information.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- There are no sections in the GitHub Customer Agreement that explicitly impose a non-compete obligation on the customer.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The license granted to the customer under the GitHub Customer Agreement is nonexclusive, suggesting that the customer is not restricted from using similar products or services from other suppliers.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Customer Agreement's focus is on the use of GitHub's products and services and does not extend to the customer's business operations or choices regarding other suppliers.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous. Justification: No, the customer's ability to develop or procure similar products or services from other suppliers is not limited under the GitHub Customer Agreement. Section 10.1 of the agreement specifically states that the parties are independent contractors and may develop products independently without using the other's Confidential Information. There are no non-compete clauses or other restrictions in the agreement that would limit the customer's ability to engage with other suppliers.
