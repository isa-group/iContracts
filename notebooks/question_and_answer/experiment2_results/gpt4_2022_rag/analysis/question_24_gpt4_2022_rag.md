```
This Agreement consists of the General Terms, the applicable Product Specific Terms and any additional terms

## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.

as expressly provided by its terms.

however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction

jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.

# Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?
## Background
The user is asking about the renewal process for the GitHub Customer Agreement. This process is typically outlined in the terms of the agreement, which would specify whether the renewal is automatic or requires action by the customer to initiate. The relevant sections of the agreement that might contain this information include those on the term and termination of the agreement, the license duration, and any specific clauses regarding renewal procedures.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement's sections on term and termination, license duration, and renewal procedures are the most relevant to the user's question.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 9.2 of the GitHub Customer Agreement mentions termination without cause and that licenses granted on a subscription basis will continue for the duration of the Subscription Term, subject to the terms of this Agreement. This implies that the customer or GitHub can terminate the agreement, but it does not explicitly state the renewal process.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.2 of the GitHub Customer Agreement states that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed. This suggests that renewal is not automatic and requires some action, but it does not specify who must initiate the renewal.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction - Applicable DPA Terms and Updates section states that when a customer renews or purchases a new subscription, the then-current DPA Terms will apply and will not change during the term of that new subscription. This indicates that there is a renewal process, but it does not clarify if it is automatic or customer-initiated.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question cannot be answered definitively without a specific clause that states whether the renewal is automatic or requires customer initiation. The provided sections suggest that renewal requires action but do not provide a clear answer.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 9 Term and termination & GitHub Customer Agreement - 1 License to use GitHub Products. Justification: The contract renewal for the GitHub Customer Agreement is not explicitly stated as automatic within the provided sections. Section 1.2 indicates that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed, which suggests that renewal requires action. However, without a specific clause stating the renewal process, it cannot be definitively said whether the renewal is automatic or needs to be initiated by the customer. Therefore, based on the available information, the renewal process is not clearly defined as automatic.
