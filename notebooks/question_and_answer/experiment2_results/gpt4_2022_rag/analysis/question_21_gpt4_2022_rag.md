(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.  
(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).  
(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:  
(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.  
(b) The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of the Netherlands.

## Document 7: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction
The parties agree that this GitHub Data Protection Agreement (“ **DPA** ”) sets forth their obligations with respect to the processing and security of
Personal Data and, where explicitly stated in the DPA Terms, Customer Data in connection with the Online Services provided by GitHub, Inc. (“ GitHub ”). The DPA (including its Appendix and Attachments) is between GitHub and any customer receiving Online Services from GitHub based on the GitHub Customer Agreement (“ Customer ”), and is incorporated by reference into the GitHub Customer Agreement.  
In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the DPA Terms and any other terms in the GitHub Customer Agreement, the DPA Terms will prevail. The provisions of the DPA Terms supersede any conflicting provisions of the GitHub Privacy Statement that otherwise may apply to processing of Personal Data. For clarity, the Standard Contractual Clauses prevail over any other term of the DPA Terms.

## Document 8: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 9: GitHub Customer Agreement - 8 Pricing and payment
```
8.1 Fees. Customer agrees to pay fees in full, up front and, if invoiced, within thirty (30) days of the invoice
date. Amounts payable are non-refundable, except as stated in this Agreement regarding Product
warranty and third-party claims. If billed based on usage, GitHub will invoice according to the billing
```  
```
model described in the Product documentation.
```
```
8.2 Late payment. If Customer fails to pay fees on time, GitHub has the right to charge 2% monthly interest
on past due amounts as allowed by law. GitHub also has the right to charge Customer for all expenses of
recovery, to terminate the applicable order, turn off access and to take any other action at law.
```
```
8.3 Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except
for taxes based on GitHub’s net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this
Agreement. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments invoiced by GitHub, Customer may
deduct such taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority, but only if
Customer promptly provides GitHub an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents
reasonably requested to allow GitHub to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. Customer will ensure that
any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.
```

# If the contract is self-renewing can the customer opt out at that time?
## Background
The user is asking about the possibility of opting out of a self-renewing contract, specifically in the context of the GitHub Customer Agreement. The relevant sections of the GitHub Customer Agreement that need to be considered to answer this question include the terms regarding the renewal of subscriptions, termination of the agreement, and any clauses that may allow or restrict the ability to opt out at the time of renewal.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement includes clauses that detail the terms of subscription renewals and terminations. Specifically, Section 9.2 allows either party to terminate the agreement without cause on 30 days' notice. This implies that a customer can opt out of a self-renewing contract by providing notice within the specified timeframe.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 1.2 of the GitHub Customer Agreement states that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed. This suggests that the customer has the opportunity to not renew the subscription, effectively opting out of the self-renewing contract.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not specify whether they are referring to a specific type of contract or any general self-renewing contract. However, since the provided context is from the GitHub Customer Agreement, it is reasonable to assume that the user is asking about GitHub's contracts.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Customer Agreement does not explicitly use the term 'self-renewing,' but the concept of subscription renewal is addressed in the agreement. The term 'self-renewing' typically refers to contracts that automatically renew for a new term unless one party provides notice of non-renewal.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Customer Agreement does not provide a specific clause titled 'self-renewing' or 'automatic renewal.' Therefore, the answer must be inferred from the general terms regarding renewal and termination.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 9 Term and termination. Justification: Yes, the customer can opt out at the time of a self-renewing contract. According to Section 9.2 of the GitHub Customer Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement without cause on 30 days' notice. Additionally, Section 1.2 indicates that licenses expire at the end of the Subscription Term unless renewed, which allows the customer to opt out by not renewing the subscription.
