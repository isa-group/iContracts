## Document 0: GitHub Customer Agreement - 6 Third party claims
6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.  
6.2 The party being defended must provide the defending party with all requested assistance, information,
and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).  
```
(a) By GitHub. GitHub will defend Customer against any third-party claim that a Product made
available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of this Agreement (unmodified as provided
by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1)
modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```
```
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its
Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade
secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates
the law or harms a third party.
```

## Document 1: GitHub Customer Agreement - 7 Limitation of liability

## Document 2: GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.

new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.

Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s

```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver

however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction

## Document 3: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```

party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 9: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA)
Additional Safeguards Addendum By this Additional Safeguards Addendum to Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (this “Addendum”), GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) provides additional safeguards to Customer and additional redress to the data subjects to whom Customer’s personal data relates.  
This Addendum supplements and is made part of, but is not in variation or modification of, the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA).  
**1. Challenges to Orders.** In addition to Clause 15.1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), in the event GitHub receives an order from any
third party for compelled disclosure of any personal data that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub shall:  
a. use every reasonable effort to redirect the third party to request data directly from Customer;  
b. promptly notify Customer, unless prohibited under the law applicable to the requesting third party, and, if prohibited from notifying
Customer, use all lawful efforts to obtain the right to waive the prohibition in order to communicate as much information to Customer as
soon as possible; and  
c. use all lawful efforts to challenge the order for disclosure on the basis of any legal deficiencies under the laws of the requesting party or
any relevant conflicts with the law of the European Union or applicable Member State law.  
For purpose of this section, lawful efforts do not include actions that would result in civil or criminal penalty such as contempt of court under the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  
**2. Indemnification of Data Subjects.** Subject to Sections 3 and 4, GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for any material or non-material damage to  
the data subject caused by GitHub’s disclosure of personal data of the data subject that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses
(EU/EEA) in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency (a “Relevant Disclosure”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under this Section 2 to the extent the data subject has already received
compensation for the same damage, whether from GitHub or otherwise.  
**3. Conditions of Indemnification.** Indemnification under Section 2 is conditional upon the data subject establishing, to GitHub’s reasonable satisfaction, that:  
a. GitHub engaged in a Relevant Disclosure;  
b. the Relevant Disclosure was the basis of an official proceeding by the non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency against
the data subject; and  
c. the Relevant Disclosure directly caused the data subject to suffer material or non-material damage.  
The data subject bears the burden of proof with respect to conditions a. though c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under Section 2 if GitHub establishes that the Relevant  
Disclosure did not violate its obligations under Chapter V of the GDPR.  
**4. Scope of Damages.** Indemnification under Section 2 is limited to material and non-material damages as provided in the GDPR and excludes
consequential damages and all other damages not resulting from GitHub’s infringement of the GDPR.  
**5. Exercise of Rights.** Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum may be enforced by the data subject against GitHub irrespective of any  
restriction in Clauses 3 or 12 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). The data subject may only bring a claim under this Addendum on an
individual basis, and not part of a class, collective, group or representative action. Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum are personal
to the data subject and may not be assigned.  
**6. Notice of Change.** In addition to Clause 14 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub agrees and warrants that it has no reason to
believe that the legislation applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which personal data is transferred either by itself or
through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under this Addendum or the
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by this Addendum or the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), it will promptly notify the change to Customer
as soon as it is aware, in which case Customer is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.
**7. Termination.** This Addendum shall automatically terminate if the European Commission, a competent Member State supervisory authority, or an
EU or competent Member State court approves a different lawful transfer mechanism that would be applicable to the data transfers covered by the  
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (and if such mechanism applies only to some of the data transfers, this Addendum will terminate only with
respect to those transfers) and that does not require the additional safeguards set forth in this Addendum.

# Does the supplier indemnify the customer for infringement of third party intellectual property?
## Background
The user is asking about the indemnification provisions related to infringement of third-party intellectual property rights within the context of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Indemnification is a contractual obligation where one party agrees to compensate the other for the harm or loss arising out of certain specified events. In the context of software and service agreements, suppliers often agree to indemnify customers against claims that the supplied product or service infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party. This is a common clause in many agreements to protect customers in the event that the use of the supplier's product results in a legal claim of infringement.

## Thoughts
- The user's question pertains to whether the supplier (GitHub) indemnifies the customer for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This is relevant because it directly addresses the indemnification clause in the agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- To answer the user's question, we need to refer to Section 6 of the GitHub Customer Agreement, specifically subsection 6.3(a), which outlines GitHub's defense obligations in the event of a third-party claim of infringement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- According to subsection 6.3(a), GitHub will defend the customer against any third-party claim that a product made available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of the agreement infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The agreement also specifies the remedies available to GitHub if it is unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, which includes modifying or replacing the product, or terminating the customer's license and refunding any license fees paid for the period after the termination date.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The indemnification clause does not cover any claims or damages due to the customer's continued use of a product after being notified to stop because of a third-party claim.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The indemnification is subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 of the agreement, which details the limitation of liability.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 6 Third party claims. Justification: Yes, the supplier (GitHub) indemnifies the customer for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This is outlined in Section 6.3(a) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, where GitHub agrees to defend the customer against any third-party claim that a product made available by GitHub for a fee and used within the scope of the agreement misappropriated a trade secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party.
