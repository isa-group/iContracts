Vendor management program - third-party risk program The data importer has a vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data importer’s vendors' risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.  
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements, undergo reassessment annually.

## Background
The user is asking whether the mandatory headquarters for GitHub, as per the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022), is located within the United States.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) provides the address of GitHub, Inc. as 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, California 94107 USA in several sections, including ANNEX I to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) - A. LIST OF PARTIES and ANNEX II to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). This address is indeed within the United States.
  - Flawed: False

- The user's question seems to be about the mandatory location of GitHub's headquarters as stipulated in the GitHub Data Protection Agreement. The provided excerpts from the agreement specify the address of GitHub, Inc., which can be understood as the location of its headquarters.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The term 'mandatory headquarters' is not explicitly used in the provided excerpts from the GitHub Data Protection Agreement. However, the address given for GitHub, Inc. is in the United States, which implies that the headquarters is located there.
  - Flawed: False
