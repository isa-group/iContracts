6.1 The parties will defend each other against third party claims described in this section and will pay the
amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party
is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement
of it.

and authority. The defending party will then reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses it incurs in providing such assistance.  
6.3 This section describes the parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims, subject to the limitations set out in Section 7 (“Limitation of liability”).

by GitHub and not combined with anything else), misappropriated a trade secret or directly
infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party. If GitHub is
unable to resolve a claim of misappropriation or infringement, it may, at its option, either (1)
modify or replace the Product with a functional equivalent or (2) terminate Customer’s license and
refund any license fees, including amounts paid in advance for any usage period after the
termination date. GitHub will not be liable for any claims or damages due to Customer’s continued
use of a Product after being notified to stop due to a third-party claim.
```
```
(b) By Customer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend GitHub and its
Affiliates against any third-party claim that: (1) any Customer Content misappropriated a trade
secret or directly infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third
party; or (2) Customer’s use of any Product, alone or in combination with anything else, violates

## Document 9: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
#### Clause 14 Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses  
(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data
importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:  
(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended
onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;  
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such
authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (^3 );  
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.  
(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees
that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.  
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has
become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).  
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these
Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data (^3) As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these
elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies. exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.  
#### Clause 15 Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities  
- 15.1 Notification
(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:  
(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or  
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.  
(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to
use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.  
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).  
(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to  
(c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.  
- 15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation  
(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).  
(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

# Does the supplier have a liability limit of 12 months' quota or higher?
## Background
The user is asking about the liability limit of a supplier, which in the context provided refers to GitHub's liability under the GitHub Customer Agreement. Specifically, the user seems to be inquiring whether GitHub's liability is capped at an amount equal to 12 months' worth of payments (quota) made by the customer for the product, or if it could be higher.

## Thoughts
- The user's question pertains to the limitation of liability clause in the GitHub Customer Agreement. It is relevant to review Section 7 of the agreement, which outlines the limitation of liability for GitHub.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 7.1(a) of the GitHub Customer Agreement states that for products ordered on a subscription basis, GitHub's maximum liability to the customer for any incident giving rise to a claim will not exceed the amount the customer paid for the product during the 12 months before the incident.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question seems to imply that they are considering whether GitHub's liability could exceed the 12 months' payments made by the customer. It is important to note that the agreement explicitly caps the liability to the amount paid in the preceding 12 months, which suggests that the liability limit cannot be higher than the 12 months' quota.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Section 7.1(d) of the agreement lists exceptions to the limitation of liability. However, these exceptions do not pertain to the overall cap on the amount but rather to the types of liabilities that are excluded from the limitation, such as confidentiality obligations, defense obligations, and violation of intellectual property rights.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not specify the type of product or service they are referring to, but the provided context from Section 7.1(a) suggests that it is related to subscription-based products. Therefore, the answer should be based on the liability limit for subscription-based products as outlined in the agreement.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- No. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 7 Limitation of liability. Justification: No, the supplier (GitHub) does not have a liability limit higher than 12 months' quota. According to Section 7.1(a) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, for products ordered on a subscription basis, GitHub's maximum liability to the customer for any incident giving rise to a claim will not exceed the amount the customer paid for the product during the 12 months before the incident.
