## Document 0: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Security Incident Notification
If GitHub becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or
access to Customer Data or Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in
connection with the Online Services (each a " **Security Incident** "), GitHub will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify Customer of the Security
Incident; (2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with detailed information about the Security Incident; (3) take reasonable steps
to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident.  
Notification(s) of Security Incidents will be delivered to one or more of Customer's administrators by any means GitHub selects, including via email.
It is Customer's sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information with GitHub and that Customer's administrators monitor for
and respond to any notifications. Customer is solely responsible for complying with its obligations under incident notification laws applicable to
Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Security Incident.  
GitHub will make reasonable efforts to assist Customer in fulfilling Customer's obligation under GDPR Article 33 or other applicable law or regulations to notify the relevant regulatory or supervisory authority and individual data subjects about a Security Incident.  
GitHub’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by GitHub of any fault or liability with respect
to the Security Incident.  
Customer must notify GitHub promptly about any possible misuse of its accounts or authentication credentials or any Security Incident related to an
Online Service.

Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.

## Document 4: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA)
Additional Safeguards Addendum By this Additional Safeguards Addendum to Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (this “Addendum”), GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) provides additional safeguards to Customer and additional redress to the data subjects to whom Customer’s personal data relates.  
This Addendum supplements and is made part of, but is not in variation or modification of, the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA).  
**1. Challenges to Orders.** In addition to Clause 15.1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), in the event GitHub receives an order from any
third party for compelled disclosure of any personal data that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub shall:  
a. use every reasonable effort to redirect the third party to request data directly from Customer;  
b. promptly notify Customer, unless prohibited under the law applicable to the requesting third party, and, if prohibited from notifying
Customer, use all lawful efforts to obtain the right to waive the prohibition in order to communicate as much information to Customer as
soon as possible; and  
c. use all lawful efforts to challenge the order for disclosure on the basis of any legal deficiencies under the laws of the requesting party or
any relevant conflicts with the law of the European Union or applicable Member State law.  
For purpose of this section, lawful efforts do not include actions that would result in civil or criminal penalty such as contempt of court under the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  
**2. Indemnification of Data Subjects.** Subject to Sections 3 and 4, GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for any material or non-material damage to  
the data subject caused by GitHub’s disclosure of personal data of the data subject that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses
(EU/EEA) in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency (a “Relevant Disclosure”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under this Section 2 to the extent the data subject has already received
compensation for the same damage, whether from GitHub or otherwise.  
**3. Conditions of Indemnification.** Indemnification under Section 2 is conditional upon the data subject establishing, to GitHub’s reasonable satisfaction, that:  
a. GitHub engaged in a Relevant Disclosure;  
b. the Relevant Disclosure was the basis of an official proceeding by the non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency against
the data subject; and  
c. the Relevant Disclosure directly caused the data subject to suffer material or non-material damage.  
The data subject bears the burden of proof with respect to conditions a. though c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under Section 2 if GitHub establishes that the Relevant  
Disclosure did not violate its obligations under Chapter V of the GDPR.  
**4. Scope of Damages.** Indemnification under Section 2 is limited to material and non-material damages as provided in the GDPR and excludes
consequential damages and all other damages not resulting from GitHub’s infringement of the GDPR.  
**5. Exercise of Rights.** Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum may be enforced by the data subject against GitHub irrespective of any  
restriction in Clauses 3 or 12 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). The data subject may only bring a claim under this Addendum on an
individual basis, and not part of a class, collective, group or representative action. Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum are personal
to the data subject and may not be assigned.  
**6. Notice of Change.** In addition to Clause 14 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub agrees and warrants that it has no reason to
believe that the legislation applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which personal data is transferred either by itself or
through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under this Addendum or the
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by this Addendum or the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), it will promptly notify the change to Customer
as soon as it is aware, in which case Customer is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.
**7. Termination.** This Addendum shall automatically terminate if the European Commission, a competent Member State supervisory authority, or an
EU or competent Member State court approves a different lawful transfer mechanism that would be applicable to the data transfers covered by the  
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (and if such mechanism applies only to some of the data transfers, this Addendum will terminate only with
respect to those transfers) and that does not require the additional safeguards set forth in this Addendum.

# Can the customer notify the supplier via email?
## Background
The user is asking whether a customer can notify the supplier, presumably GitHub in this context, via email. This question likely pertains to the communication protocols established in the agreements between GitHub and its customers, specifically in scenarios such as reporting a security incident, providing formal notice, or any other contractual obligations that may require notification from the customer to GitHub.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Customer Agreement section 10.10 explicitly states that notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com, which indicates that customers can indeed notify GitHub via email for formal notices.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The GitHub Data Protection Agreement also provides contact information for privacy-related concerns, which includes an email address and a web form, suggesting that email communication is an acceptable method for certain types of notifications.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The user's question does not specify the type of notification, but given the context provided in the agreements, it is reasonable to assume that email notifications are generally acceptable unless specified otherwise for particular circumstances.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous. Justification: Yes, the customer can notify the supplier via email. This is supported by the GitHub Customer Agreement section 10.10, which states that notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com.
  - Score: 10
