## Document 2: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ATTACHMENT 1 – THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES (EU/EEA) Controller to Processor - SECTION II **–** OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
#### Clause 8 Data protection safeguards  
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.  
8.1 Instructions
(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of
the contract.
(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.  
8.2 Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.  
8. 3 Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  
8.4 Accuracy  
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.  
8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data  
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).  
8.6 Security of processing  
(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data,
including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter
‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.  
(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.  
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.  
(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to
notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.  
8.7 Sensitive data  
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.  
8.8 Onward transfers  
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (^1 ) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:  
(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;  
(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;  
(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or  
(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.  
8.9 Documentation and compliance  
(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.  
(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data
exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.  
(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data
importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.  
(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.  
#### Clause 9 Use of sub-processors  
(a) GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data
importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 90 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.  
(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data
subjects. (^2 ) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor
complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.  
(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a subprocessor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent
necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.  
(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data
importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.  
(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law
or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the subprocessor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data (^2) This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in
accordance with Clause 7.  
#### Clause 10 Data subject rights  
(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised
to do so by the data exporter.  
(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In
this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall
be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.  
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.  
#### Clause 11 Redress  
(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle
complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.  
(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a
timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.  
(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:  
(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;  
(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.  
(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.  
(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.  
(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable
laws.  
#### Clause 12 Liability  
(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.  
(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under
these Clauses.  
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material
damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU)
2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.  
(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from
the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.  
(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally
liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.  
(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.  
(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.  
#### Clause 13 Supervision  
(a) [Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with
these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.

Personal Data. Customer and GitHub will comply with applicable data protection laws.
```

## Document 5: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors
GitHub may hire Subprocessors to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to this engagement and to GitHub
Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by GitHub of the
processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under applicable law, the Standard Contractual Clauses or the GDPR Related Terms.  
GitHub is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with GitHub’s obligations in this DPA. GitHub makes available information about
Subprocessors on the GitHub website https://github.com/subprocessors (or a successor location). When engaging any Subprocessor, GitHub will
ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services GitHub has
retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. GitHub will ensure that Subprocessors
are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of GitHub by the DPA, including the
limitations on disclosure of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to oversee the Subprocessors to ensure that these contractual obligations are met.  
From time to time, GitHub may engage new Subprocessors. GitHub will give Customer notice (by updating the website at https://github.com/github-
subprocessors-list (or a successor location) and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor in
advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data. If GitHub engages a new Subprocessor for a new Online Service, GitHub will give Customer notice prior to availability of that Online Service.  
If Customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Service without penalty
by providing, before the end of the relevant notice period, written notice of termination. Customer may also include an explanation of the grounds
for non-approval together with the termination notice, in order to permit GitHub to re-evaluate any such new Subprocessor based on the applicable
concerns. If the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite.
After termination, GitHub will remove payment obligations for any subscriptions for the terminated Online Service from subsequent invoices to Customer or its reseller.

## Document 6: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction

Vendor management program - third-party risk program The data importer has a vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data importer’s vendors' risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.  
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements, undergo reassessment annually.

# Does the customer retain ownership of the data he provides to the supplier?
## Background
The user question pertains to the ownership of data provided by a customer to a supplier, specifically in the context of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022). Ownership of data is a critical aspect of data protection and privacy agreements, as it determines who has the legal rights and control over the data. The terms of service or data protection agreements usually outline the ownership and usage rights of customer data when it is processed or stored by a supplier or service provider like GitHub.

## Thoughts
- The GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) explicitly addresses the issue of data ownership in the section titled 'Nature of Data Processing; Ownership'.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- According to the agreement, the customer retains all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data. GitHub acquires no rights in Customer Data other than the rights Customer grants to GitHub in this section.
  - Flawed: False
