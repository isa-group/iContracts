## Document 0: GitHub Customer Agreement - 4 Confidentiality
4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

## Document 2: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ATTACHMENT 1 – THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES (EU/EEA) Controller to Processor - SECTION II **–** OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
#### Clause 8 Data protection safeguards  
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.  
8.1 Instructions
(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of
the contract.
(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.  
8.2 Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.  
8. 3 Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  
8.4 Accuracy  
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.  
8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data  
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).  
8.6 Security of processing  
(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data,
including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter
‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.  
(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.  
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.  
(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to
notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.  
8.7 Sensitive data  
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.  
8.8 Onward transfers  
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (^1 ) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:  
(i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;  
(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;  
(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or  
(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.  
8.9 Documentation and compliance  
(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.  
(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data
exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.  
(d) The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data
importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.  
(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.  
#### Clause 9 Use of sub-processors  
(a) GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data
importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 90 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.  
(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data
subjects. (^2 ) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor
complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.  
(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a subprocessor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent
necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.  
(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data
importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.  
(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law
or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the subprocessor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data (^2) This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in
accordance with Clause 7.  
#### Clause 10 Data subject rights  
(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised
to do so by the data exporter.  
(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In
this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall
be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.  
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.  
#### Clause 11 Redress  
(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle
complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.  
(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a
timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.  
(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:  
(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;  
(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.  
(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.  
(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.  
(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable
laws.  
#### Clause 12 Liability  
(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.  
(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under
these Clauses.  
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material
damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU)
2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.  
(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from
the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer’s responsibility for the damage.  
(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally
liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.  
(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.  
(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.  
#### Clause 13 Supervision  
(a) [Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State:] The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
[Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.  
(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with
these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.

## Document 6: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Data Security
GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards against accidental or unlawful
destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in
accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with
these measures and safeguards and will continue to take appropriate steps throughout the term of the GitHub Customer Agreement. Appendix A –
Security Safeguards contains a description of the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented by GitHub.  
Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures and security
safeguards for an Online Service meet Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under applicable Data Protection
Requirements. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of the processing of its Customer Data and Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons) the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented and maintained by GitHub provide a
level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Customer Data and Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls.  
GitHub will provide security compliance reporting such as external SOC1, type 2 and SOC2, type2 audit reports upon Customer request. Customer
agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the applicable Data Protection Requirements (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of
the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will otherwise only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report
does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation.  
Should Customer be subject to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation or carry out an audit or investigation in response to a
request by a regulatory or supervisory authority that requires participation from GitHub, and Customers’ obligations cannot reasonably be satisfied
(where allowable by Customer’s regulators) through audit reports, documentation, or compliance information that GitHub makes generally available
to its customers, then GitHub will promptly respond to Customer’s additional instructions and requests for information, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:  
- GitHub will provide access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, and application software.
- Customer and GitHub will mutually agree in a prior written agreement (email is acceptable) upon the scope, timing, duration, control and
evidence requirements, provided that this requirement to agree will not permit GitHub to unreasonably delay its cooperation.
- Customer must ensure its regulator’s use of an independent, accredited third-party audit firm, during regular business hours, with
reasonable advance written notice to GitHub, and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Neither Customer, its regulators, nor
its regulators’ delegates shall have access to any data from GitHub’s other customers or to GitHub systems or facilities not involved in the Online Services.
- Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer, including all reasonable
costs and fees for any and all time GitHub expends, in addition to the rates for services performed by GitHub.
- If the report generated from GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer includes any findings pertaining to GitHub, Customer will share such report, findings, and recommended actions with GitHub where allowed by Customer’s regulators.

## Document 7: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA)
Additional Safeguards Addendum By this Additional Safeguards Addendum to Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (this “Addendum”), GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) provides additional safeguards to Customer and additional redress to the data subjects to whom Customer’s personal data relates.  
This Addendum supplements and is made part of, but is not in variation or modification of, the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA).  
**1. Challenges to Orders.** In addition to Clause 15.1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), in the event GitHub receives an order from any
third party for compelled disclosure of any personal data that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub shall:  
a. use every reasonable effort to redirect the third party to request data directly from Customer;  
b. promptly notify Customer, unless prohibited under the law applicable to the requesting third party, and, if prohibited from notifying
Customer, use all lawful efforts to obtain the right to waive the prohibition in order to communicate as much information to Customer as
soon as possible; and  
c. use all lawful efforts to challenge the order for disclosure on the basis of any legal deficiencies under the laws of the requesting party or
any relevant conflicts with the law of the European Union or applicable Member State law.  
For purpose of this section, lawful efforts do not include actions that would result in civil or criminal penalty such as contempt of court under the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  
**2. Indemnification of Data Subjects.** Subject to Sections 3 and 4, GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for any material or non-material damage to  
the data subject caused by GitHub’s disclosure of personal data of the data subject that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses
(EU/EEA) in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency (a “Relevant Disclosure”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under this Section 2 to the extent the data subject has already received
compensation for the same damage, whether from GitHub or otherwise.  
**3. Conditions of Indemnification.** Indemnification under Section 2 is conditional upon the data subject establishing, to GitHub’s reasonable satisfaction, that:  
a. GitHub engaged in a Relevant Disclosure;  
b. the Relevant Disclosure was the basis of an official proceeding by the non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency against
the data subject; and  
c. the Relevant Disclosure directly caused the data subject to suffer material or non-material damage.  
The data subject bears the burden of proof with respect to conditions a. though c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under Section 2 if GitHub establishes that the Relevant  
Disclosure did not violate its obligations under Chapter V of the GDPR.  
**4. Scope of Damages.** Indemnification under Section 2 is limited to material and non-material damages as provided in the GDPR and excludes
consequential damages and all other damages not resulting from GitHub’s infringement of the GDPR.  
**5. Exercise of Rights.** Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum may be enforced by the data subject against GitHub irrespective of any  
restriction in Clauses 3 or 12 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). The data subject may only bring a claim under this Addendum on an
individual basis, and not part of a class, collective, group or representative action. Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum are personal
to the data subject and may not be assigned.  
**6. Notice of Change.** In addition to Clause 14 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub agrees and warrants that it has no reason to
believe that the legislation applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which personal data is transferred either by itself or
through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under this Addendum or the
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by this Addendum or the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), it will promptly notify the change to Customer
as soon as it is aware, in which case Customer is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.
**7. Termination.** This Addendum shall automatically terminate if the European Commission, a competent Member State supervisory authority, or an
EU or competent Member State court approves a different lawful transfer mechanism that would be applicable to the data transfers covered by the  
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (and if such mechanism applies only to some of the data transfers, this Addendum will terminate only with
respect to those transfers) and that does not require the additional safeguards set forth in this Addendum.

## Document 8: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Disclosure of Processed Data
GitHub will not disclose or provide access to any Processed Data except: (1) as Customer directs; (2) as described in this DPA; or (3) as required by law. For purposes of this section, “Processed Data” means: (a) Customer Data; (b) Personal Data and (c) any other data processed by GitHub in  
connection with the Online Service that is Customer’s confidential information under the GitHub Customer Agreement. All processing of Processed Data is subject to GitHub’s obligation of confidentiality under the GitHub Customer Agreement.  
GitHub will not disclose or provide access to any Processed Data to law enforcement unless required by law. If law enforcement contacts GitHub with a demand for Processed Data, GitHub will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer. If compelled to disclose or provide access to any Processed Data to law enforcement, GitHub will promptly notify Customer and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so.  
Upon receipt of any other third-party request for Processed Data, GitHub will promptly notify Customer unless prohibited by law. GitHub will reject the request unless required by law to comply. If the request is valid, GitHub will attempt to redirect the third party to request the data directly from Customer.  
GitHub will not provide any third party: (a) direct, indirect, blanket, or unfettered access to Processed Data; (b) platform encryption keys used to secure Processed Data or the ability to break such encryption; or (c) access to Processed Data if GitHub is aware that the data is to be used for purposes other than those stated in the third party’s request.  
In support of the above, GitHub may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the third party.

## Document 9: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - GENERAL TERMS
