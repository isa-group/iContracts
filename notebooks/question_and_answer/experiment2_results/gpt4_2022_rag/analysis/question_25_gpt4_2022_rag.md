## Document 0: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
#### Clause 14 Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses  
(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data
importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.  
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:  
(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended
onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;  
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such
authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (^3 );  
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.  
(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees
that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.  
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has
become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).  
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these
Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data (^3) As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these
elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies. exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.  
#### Clause 15 Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities  
- 15.1 Notification
(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:  
(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or  
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.  
(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to
use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.  
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).  
(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to  
(c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.  
- 15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation  
(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).  
(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.  
(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

## Document 8: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Attachment 2 – International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses
This Addendum has been issued by the Information Commissioner for Parties making Restricted Transfers. The Information Commissioner considers that it provides Appropriate Safeguards for Restricted Transfers when it is entered into as a legally binding contract.

## Document 9: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA)
Additional Safeguards Addendum By this Additional Safeguards Addendum to Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (this “Addendum”), GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) provides additional safeguards to Customer and additional redress to the data subjects to whom Customer’s personal data relates.  
This Addendum supplements and is made part of, but is not in variation or modification of, the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA).  
**1. Challenges to Orders.** In addition to Clause 15.1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), in the event GitHub receives an order from any
third party for compelled disclosure of any personal data that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub shall:  
a. use every reasonable effort to redirect the third party to request data directly from Customer;  
b. promptly notify Customer, unless prohibited under the law applicable to the requesting third party, and, if prohibited from notifying
Customer, use all lawful efforts to obtain the right to waive the prohibition in order to communicate as much information to Customer as
soon as possible; and  
c. use all lawful efforts to challenge the order for disclosure on the basis of any legal deficiencies under the laws of the requesting party or
any relevant conflicts with the law of the European Union or applicable Member State law.  
For purpose of this section, lawful efforts do not include actions that would result in civil or criminal penalty such as contempt of court under the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  
**2. Indemnification of Data Subjects.** Subject to Sections 3 and 4, GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for any material or non-material damage to  
the data subject caused by GitHub’s disclosure of personal data of the data subject that has been transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses
(EU/EEA) in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency (a “Relevant Disclosure”). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under this Section 2 to the extent the data subject has already received
compensation for the same damage, whether from GitHub or otherwise.  
**3. Conditions of Indemnification.** Indemnification under Section 2 is conditional upon the data subject establishing, to GitHub’s reasonable satisfaction, that:  
a. GitHub engaged in a Relevant Disclosure;  
b. the Relevant Disclosure was the basis of an official proceeding by the non-EU/EEA government body or law enforcement agency against
the data subject; and  
c. the Relevant Disclosure directly caused the data subject to suffer material or non-material damage.  
The data subject bears the burden of proof with respect to conditions a. though c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GitHub shall have no obligation to indemnify the data subject under Section 2 if GitHub establishes that the Relevant  
Disclosure did not violate its obligations under Chapter V of the GDPR.  
**4. Scope of Damages.** Indemnification under Section 2 is limited to material and non-material damages as provided in the GDPR and excludes
consequential damages and all other damages not resulting from GitHub’s infringement of the GDPR.  
**5. Exercise of Rights.** Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum may be enforced by the data subject against GitHub irrespective of any  
restriction in Clauses 3 or 12 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). The data subject may only bring a claim under this Addendum on an
individual basis, and not part of a class, collective, group or representative action. Rights granted to data subjects under this Addendum are personal
to the data subject and may not be assigned.  
**6. Notice of Change.** In addition to Clause 14 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), GitHub agrees and warrants that it has no reason to
believe that the legislation applicable to it or its sub-processors, including in any country to which personal data is transferred either by itself or
through a sub-processor, prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under this Addendum or the
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by this Addendum or the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA), it will promptly notify the change to Customer
as soon as it is aware, in which case Customer is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract.
**7. Termination.** This Addendum shall automatically terminate if the European Commission, a competent Member State supervisory authority, or an
EU or competent Member State court approves a different lawful transfer mechanism that would be applicable to the data transfers covered by the  
Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) (and if such mechanism applies only to some of the data transfers, this Addendum will terminate only with
respect to those transfers) and that does not require the additional safeguards set forth in this Addendum.

# What is the mandatory governing law?
## Background
The user is asking about the mandatory governing law, which refers to the legal jurisdiction that governs a contract or agreement. In the context of agreements or contracts, the governing law is the law that will be used to interpret the terms of the contract, resolve any disputes, and enforce the provisions of the contract. The governing law is typically specified within the contract itself, and it is an important aspect because it can affect how the contract is executed and how disputes are settled. In international agreements, the governing law is crucial as it determines which country's legal system will apply in case of legal proceedings. The user's question likely pertains to a specific agreement or set of terms and conditions, possibly related to data protection, given the provided context of the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022).

## Answer
- Yes. Section(s): GitHub Customer Agreement - 10 Miscellaneous. Justification: The mandatory governing law for the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) is specified in the GitHub Customer Agreement under '10 Miscellaneous', specifically in section 10.11 'Applicable law and venue'. It states that the Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States, with legal actions or proceedings to be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. However, if the Customer's principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland, the Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland, with legal actions or proceedings to be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin.
