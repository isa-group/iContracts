# Evaluation of question Does the supplier have to delete personal information after the end of the contract?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No, because customer data is only destroyed at the customer's request and if lawful (data protection document, Data Retention and Deletion section).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: Yes. Yes, the supplier, as outlined in the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022), is obligated to delete personal information after the end of the contract. Specifically, the 'Data Retention and Deletion' section of the agreement states that upon the customer's reasonable request, unless prohibited by law, GitHub will return or destroy all Customer Data and Personal Data processed on behalf of the customer at all locations where it is stored within 30 days of the request, provided that it is no longer needed for providing the Online Services or the purposes for which a data subject had authorized the processing of their Personal Data.
