# Evaluation of question Is the contract renewal automatic or does it need to be initiated by the customer?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Needs to be initiated, according to CA product licenses expire at the end of the subscription period, unless renewed (section 1.2 Duration of licenses).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: No. The contract renewal for the GitHub Customer Agreement is not explicitly stated as automatic within the provided sections. Section 1.2 indicates that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed, which suggests that renewal requires action. However, without a specific clause stating the renewal process, it cannot be definitively said whether the renewal is automatic or needs to be initiated by the customer. Therefore, based on the available information, the renewal process is not clearly defined as automatic.
