# Evaluation of question Does the supplier have a liability limit of 12 months' quota or higher?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, as GitHub will not exceed the amount the customer has paid for the product during the 12 months prior to the incident (secBon 7.1 (a) Products).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: No. No, the supplier (GitHub) does not have a liability limit higher than 12 months' quota. According to Section 7.1(a) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, for products ordered on a subscription basis, GitHub's maximum liability to the customer for any incident giving rise to a claim will not exceed the amount the customer paid for the product during the 12 months before the incident.
## Thoughts
- Answer 1 states that GitHub's liability is limited to the amount paid by the customer for the product during the 12 months prior to the incident.

- Answer 2 also mentions that GitHub's liability is capped at the amount paid by the customer for the product during the 12 months before the incident.

- Both answers refer to the same section of the GitHub Customer Agreement (Section 7.1(a)) as the source of their information.

- The main difference is that Answer 1 starts with 'Yes,' implying that GitHub does have a liability limit of 12 months' quota or higher.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Answer 2 starts with 'No,' indicating that GitHub does not have a liability limit higher than 12 months' quota.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The confusion arises from the interpretation of the question. If '12 months' quota or higher' is understood as 'up to 12 months' quota,' then Answer 1 is correct. If it is understood as 'more than 12 months' quota,' then Answer 2 is correct.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The question asks if the liability limit is '12 months' quota or higher,' which suggests any limit up to and including 12 months' worth of payments, or more.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Since both answers agree that the limit is exactly the amount paid in the last 12 months, they effectively convey the same meaning regarding the liability limit.

## Assesment
- Match. Justification: Both answers convey the same meaning that GitHub's liability limit is capped at the amount paid by the customer for the product during the 12 months before the incident. The apparent contradiction is due to the different interpretations of the question, but both answers agree on the actual liability limit as stated in the GitHub Customer Agreement.
