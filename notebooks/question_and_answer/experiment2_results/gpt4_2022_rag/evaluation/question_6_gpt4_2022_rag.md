# Evaluation of question Can the supplier make modifications to the products or services?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: Yes, because GitHub has the right to make changes to products if they do not materially diminish the functionality of the product.

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: Yes. Yes, the supplier, GitHub, can make modifications to the products or services. According to the GitHub Customer Agreement and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement, GitHub has the right to make changes to the products if such changes do not materially lessen the product's functionality. They may also introduce new features, supplements, or related software with their own terms, which may apply to the customer's use of those new elements. However, customers have a choice to use the new features without loss of existing functionality, and if they do not use the new features, the corresponding new terms will not apply. Additionally, GitHub may modify or terminate an Online Service in response to government regulation or requirements that present a hardship for GitHub to continue operating the service without modification. These details are found in the GitHub Customer Agreement - 1 License to use GitHub Products and the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - Introduction - Applicable DPA Terms and Updates sections.
