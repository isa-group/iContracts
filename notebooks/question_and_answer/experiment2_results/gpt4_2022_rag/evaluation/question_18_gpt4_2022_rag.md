- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: No. No, the supplier indemnifying for infringement of third party intellectual property is not exempt from the limit of liability. According to Section 7(d) of the GitHub Customer Agreement, no limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either party's violation of the other party's intellectual property rights. This means that while GitHub does provide indemnification for certain intellectual property infringement claims under Section 6, this indemnification is not exempt from the limitations of liability outlined in Section 7.
