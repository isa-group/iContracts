# Evaluation of question Are the customer's indemnification obligations limited in third party claims?
## Background
- Manual analysis answer is: No, since the parties mutually defend each other and will contribute the amount of any final judgment (section 6 Third party claims).

- GPT-4 analysis answer with the strategy gpt4_2022_rag is: Yes. Yes, the customer's indemnification obligations are limited in third-party claims as outlined in the GitHub Customer Agreement. Specifically, Section 7 (Limitation of liability) of the agreement limits each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other and excludes certain types of damages from liability, such as indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages. These limitations would apply to the indemnification obligations described in Section 6 (Third party claims), thereby limiting the scope of the customer's financial responsibility in the event of a third-party claim.
