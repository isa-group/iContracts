## Document 1
1.1 **License grant.** Products are licensed and not sold. Subject to Customer’s compliance with this
Agreement, GitHub grants to Customer a nonexclusive and limited license to install and use the
Products ordered as provided in the applicable Product Specific Terms and this Agreement. The licenses
are only for Customer’s internal business purposes and are non-transferable except as expressly
permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.  
1.2 **Duration of licenses.** Licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed.  
1.3 **Accounts.** Customer may assign each Subscription License to one individual End User for use or access
on any number of devices. Customer may not reassign a Subscription License to another End User
within 90 days of the last assignment, except where End User’s relationship with Customer ends or End
User goes on leave. End User accounts may not be shared by individuals.  
1.4 **End Users.** Customer controls access to and use of the Products by End Users. Customer is responsible
for End Users’ use.  
1.5 **Product Specific Terms.** Product Specific Terms apply to Products such as, but not limited to, GitHub AE,
GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. If there is a conflict between the Product
Specific Terms and the General Terms, the Product Specific Terms apply for that Product.  
1.6 **Previews**. Previews are provided “AS-IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. GitHub may change
or discontinue Previews at any time without notice.  
1.7 **Product changes.** GitHub has the right to make changes to the Products if such changes do not
materially lessen the Product’s functionality. GitHub may provide additional terms that apply to
Customer’s use of updates, new features, or related software.  
1.8 **Affiliates.** Customer’s Affiliates may use the Products under this Agreement. Customer is responsible for
its Affiliates’ use, and Customer has the sole right to enforce this Agreement.  
1.9 **Compliance with laws.** Customer’s use of the Products must not violate any applicable laws, including
copyright or trademark laws, export control laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in its
jurisdiction.  
1.10 **Reservation of rights.** Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
international treaties. GitHub reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, and no rights
are granted or implied by waiver or estoppel.  
1.11 **Feedback.** Feedback by Customer is optional and voluntary. Feedback may be used by GitHub for
any purpose without obligation of any kind as long as the Customer’s confidential information
remains confidential.  
1.12 **Restrictions.** Unless expressly permitted in this Agreement or by law, Customer may not:  
```
(a) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Product, or try to do so;
```
```
(b) run, upgrade or downgrade, or transfer parts of a Product separately at different times or on
different devices;
(c) install, use, or distribute other software or technology in any way that makes
GitHub’s intellectual property or technology subject to any other license terms;
```
```
(d) work around technical limitations in a Product or restrictions in Product documentation; or
```
```
(e) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute or lend any Products to others, in whole or in part, or host
Products for use by others.
```

4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

Description of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data
importer(s) (including any relevant certifications) to ensure an appropriate level of security,
taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons  
1. Data Security Certifications. Data importer holds the following data security
certifications as applicable:
- SOC 1, Type 2;
- SOC 2, Type 2; and,
- ISO 27001:2013.
2. Personnel. Data importer’s personnel will not process personal data without
authorization. Personnel are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any such
personal data and this obligation continues even after their engagement ends.
3. Data Privacy Contact. The data privacy officer of the data importer can be reached at
dpo@github.com and the following address: GitHub, Inc. Attn: Privacy, 88 Colin P.
Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, California 94107 USA
4. Technical and Organization Measures. GitHub implements and maintains the technical
and organizational measures and security safeguards listed in Table 1 below for
processing Customer Personal Data on behalf and in accordance with Customer
Instructions in connection with the Online Services. These measures in conjunction with
the security commitments in this DPA are GitHub’s only responsibility with respect to
the security of that data.
5. Vendor management program - third-party risk program. The data importer has a
vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection
agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use
case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data
importer’s vendors’ risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or
processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements,
undergo reassessment annually.

ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). Additional Safeguards Addendum  
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra
safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but
does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.  
**I. Challenges to Orders:** If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal
data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
- **a.** Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
- **b.** Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
- **c.** Challenge the disclosure order legally.  
**II. Indemnification of Data Subjects:** GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages
caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA
government body.  
- **a.** **No Obligation to Indemnify:**
**i.** If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
**ii.** If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.  
- **b.** **Conditions of Indemnification:** Indemnification depends on the data subject proving that:
**i.** GitHub disclosed the data;
**ii.** This led to an official proceeding against them; and
**iii.** The disclosure directly caused damage.  
- **c.** **Scope of Damages:** Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.  
**III. Exercise of Rights:** Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against
GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be
individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.  
**IV. Notice of Change:** GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject
allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a
legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then
suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.  
**V. Termination:** This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved
that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these
additional safeguards.

## Document 5
10.1 **Independent contractors.** The parties are independent contractors. Customer and GitHub may develop
products independently without using the other’s Confidential Information.  
10.2 **Amendments.** GitHub may require Customer to accept revised or additional terms before processing a
new order. Any additional or conflicting terms and conditions presented by Customer are expressly
rejected and will not apply.  
10.3 **Order of precedence.** Conflicting terms in the Product Specific Terms take precedence over these
General Terms as to the applicable Products. The parties may agree on changes to Section 8 Pricing and
payment and Section 10.11 Law and venue by a signed order form. Other than that, these General
Terms will take precedence over any conflicting terms in other documents.  
10.4 **Assignment.** Either party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate but it must notify the other party in
writing of the assignment. GitHub may also assign its rights to receive payment and enforce Customer’s
payment obligations. Any other assignment of this Agreement must be approved by the other party in
writing. Such notification to GitHub shall be made to the account manager at GitHub. Any attempted
assignment without required approval will be void.  
10.5 **Compliance with trade laws.** The parties acknowledge that the Products may be subject to U.S. and
other countries’ export jurisdictions. Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to
the import or export of the Products, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration  
```
Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control (“trade laws”). Customer will not take any action that causes GitHub to
violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws. If Customer learns of a potential violation of trade laws
relating to the performance of this Agreement, or a potential violation of the terms in this subsection, it
will alert GitHub as soon as possible, but in no event more than 14 days after acquiring this knowledge.
GitHub may suspend or terminate this Agreement to the extent that it reasonably concludes that
performance would cause it to violate U.S. or other applicable trade laws, including those described
above, or put it at risk of becoming the subject of economic sanctions under such trade laws.
```
10.6 **Severability.** If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.  
10.7 **Waiver.** Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver. Any waiver
must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.  
10.8 **No third-party beneficiaries.** This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights except
as expressly provided by its terms.  
10.9 **Survival.** All provisions survive termination of this Agreement except those requiring performance only
during the term of the Agreement.  
10.10 **Notices.** Notices to GitHub may be submitted via email to legal@support.github.com. If Customer  
```
wishes to formally service notice on GitHub, it must be made through GitHub’s registered agent:
```
```
GitHub, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N
Sacramento, CA 95833- 3505

```
Notices must be in writing and will be treated as delivered on the date received at the address, date
shown on the return receipt, email transmission date, or date on the courier confirmation of delivery.
Notices to Customer will be sent to the individual at the address Customer identifies on its account as
its contact for notices. Customer shall ensure its contact for notices is up to date during each renewal.
GitHub may send notices and other information to Customer by email or other electronic form.
```
10.11 **Applicable law and venue.** This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and federal laws of the United States. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California. The
parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.  
```
If Customer’s principal office is within the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland,
however, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ireland. Any legal action or proceeding will
be brought exclusively in the courts located in Dublin. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction
and venue there.
```
```
The above choices of venue do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in any
jurisdiction with respect to a violation of intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations.
```
```
The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related
instruments will not apply to this Agreement.
```
10.12 **GitHub Affiliates and contractors.** GitHub may perform its obligations under this Agreement through its
Affiliates and use contractors to provide certain services. GitHub remains responsible for their
performance.  
10.13 **U.S. Public Sector Amendment.** The U.S. Public Sector Amendment applies if you are a Government
Entity, as defined in that amendment.  
10.14 **Government procurement rules.** By accepting this Agreement, Customer represents and warrants that
(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable government procurement laws and regulations;
(2) it is authorized to enter into this Agreement; and (3) this Agreement satisfies all applicable
procurement requirements.

# Are the rights of use the supplier receives over the customer's data limited to what is strictly necessary?
## Background
The user question pertains to the rights of use that a supplier, in this case, GitHub, receives over the customer's data. The context provided is a comprehensive set of terms and conditions that outline the legal framework governing the use of GitHub's products and services, the handling of personal data, and the obligations of both GitHub and its customers regarding data protection and usage rights. The terms include license grants, duration of licenses, account management, end-user responsibilities, product-specific terms, previews, product changes, affiliate usage, compliance with laws, reservation of rights, restrictions on use, confidentiality obligations, technical and organizational measures for data security, indemnification provisions, and legal compliance with trade laws, among others. The user is specifically interested in understanding whether the rights that GitHub has over the customer's data are limited to what is strictly necessary for the provision of the services outlined in the agreement.

## Thoughts
- The terms provided indicate that GitHub grants customers a nonexclusive and limited license to use the products, and the licenses are non-transferable except as expressly permitted under the agreement or applicable law. This suggests that GitHub's rights over the customer's data are intended to be limited to what is necessary for providing the licensed products and services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The confidentiality section of the terms specifies that GitHub will take reasonable steps to protect the customer's confidential information and will only use it as part of the business relationship. This further implies that GitHub's rights to use the customer's data are restricted to the scope of the business relationship and the provision of services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The data protection addendum (DPA) and the technical and organizational measures indicate that GitHub is committed to ensuring an appropriate level of security for personal data and will not process personal data without authorization. This supports the notion that GitHub's rights over the customer's data are limited to what is necessary for the services provided.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The restrictions section explicitly prohibits certain actions by the customer that could potentially extend GitHub's rights over the data, such as reverse engineering or sublicensing the products. This suggests that the agreement is designed to prevent the expansion of rights over the customer's data beyond what is necessary.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The indemnification provisions and additional safeguards for data subjects in the context of data transfers indicate that GitHub takes responsibility for the protection of personal data and limits its use to the terms agreed upon, which would include only what is necessary for the provision of services.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The terms do not provide explicit percentages or quantifiable measures of what constitutes 'strictly necessary' use of customer data, which could lead to ambiguity in interpreting the extent of GitHub's rights over the data.
  - Flawed: True
  - Helpful: False

## Answer
- Yes, the rights of use that GitHub receives over the customer's data are limited to what is strictly necessary for the provision of services. The terms of the agreement, including license grants, confidentiality obligations, and data protection addendums, all indicate that GitHub's use of customer data is restricted to the scope of providing the licensed products and services and ensuring data security. The agreement is designed to prevent the expansion of rights over the customer's data beyond what is necessary for these purposes.
