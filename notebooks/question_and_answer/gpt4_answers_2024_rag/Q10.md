4.1 **Existing NDA.** If the parties have entered into a non-disclosure agreement, those terms apply instead of
this confidentiality section.  
4.2 **Confidential Information.** “Confidential Information” is non-public information in any form that is
marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential. This includes,
but is not limited to, Customer Content, the terms of this Agreement and Customer’s account
authentication credentials.
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
```
(a) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
```
```
(b) was received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation;
(c) is independently developed; or
```
```
(d) is Feedback.
```
4.3 **Protection of Confidential Information.** Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s
Confidential Information. A party will only use the other party’s Confidential Information as part of the
parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties. A
party may only share Confidential Information with a party’s Representatives on a need-to-know basis,
under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains
responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives. A party must promptly notify
the other party if it discovers any unauthorized use or disclosure.  
4.4 **Disclosure required by law.** A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law,
but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) so that the other party can seek a
protective order.  
4.5 **Residual information.** Neither party is required to restrict its Representatives in other work assignments
if they have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information
retained in Representatives’ unaided memories in the development or deployment of the parties’
respective products or services does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law.  
4.6 **Duration of confidentiality obligation.** These confidentiality obligations apply (1) for Customer Content,
until it is deleted from the Online Services; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of
five years after a party receives the Confidential Information.

Description of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the data
importer(s) (including any relevant certifications) to ensure an appropriate level of security,
taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons  
1. Data Security Certifications. Data importer holds the following data security
certifications as applicable:
- SOC 1, Type 2;
- SOC 2, Type 2; and,
- ISO 27001:2013.
2. Personnel. Data importer’s personnel will not process personal data without
authorization. Personnel are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any such

dpo@github.com and the following address: GitHub, Inc. Attn: Privacy, 88 Colin P.
Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, California 94107 USA
4. Technical and Organization Measures. GitHub implements and maintains the technical
and organizational measures and security safeguards listed in Table 1 below for
processing Customer Personal Data on behalf and in accordance with Customer
Instructions in connection with the Online Services. These measures in conjunction with
the security commitments in this DPA are GitHub’s only responsibility with respect to
the security of that data.
5. Vendor management program - third-party risk program. The data importer has a
vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection
agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use
case is requested. The data importer’s vendor risk program is structured so all of data
importer’s vendors’ risk assessments are refreshed two years from the last review date.
Vendors deemed high risk, such as data center providers or other vendors storing or
processing data in scope for the data importer’s regulatory or contractual requirements,
undergo reassessment annually.

ANNEX IV to the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA). Additional Safeguards Addendum  
This Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (“Addendum”) by GitHub provides extra
safeguards and redress for data subjects linked to Customer's personal data. It supplements but
does not modify the Standard Contractual Clauses.  
**I. Challenges to Orders:** If GitHub receives an order demanding disclosure of personal
data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses, GitHub will:
- **a.** Redirect the third party to request data from the Customer;
- **b.** Inform the Customer unless legally prohibited, striving to waive this prohibition;
- **c.** Challenge the disclosure order legally.  
**II. Indemnification of Data Subjects:** GitHub shall indemnify a data subject for damages
caused by GitHub's disclosure of their data in response to an order from a non-EU/EEA
government body.  
- **a.** **No Obligation to Indemnify:**
**i.** If the data subject has already received compensation for the same damage, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.
**ii.** If GitHub can prove the disclosure did not violate Chapter V of the GDPR, GitHub has no obligation to indemnify.  
- **b.** **Conditions of Indemnification:** Indemnification depends on the data subject proving that:
**i.** GitHub disclosed the data;
**ii.** This led to an official proceeding against them; and
**iii.** The disclosure directly caused damage.  
- **c.** **Scope of Damages:** Indemnification covers only damages defined in the GDPR, excluding consequential and other damages not due to GitHub’s GDPR infringement.  
**III. Exercise of Rights:** Data subjects can enforce their rights under this Addendum against
GitHub irrespective of any restrictions in the Standard Contractual Clauses. Claims must be
individual, not part of a collective action, and are non-transferable.  
**IV. Notice of Change:** GitHub warrants that the current legislation to which it is subject
allows it to fulfill obligations under this Addendum and the Standard Contractual Clauses. If a
legal change affecting these obligations occurs, GitHub will notify the Customer, who can then
suspend data transfer or terminate the contract.  
**V. Termination:** This Addendum ends if a different lawful transfer mechanism is approved
that covers the data transfers of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and doesn't require these
additional safeguards.

## Document 9
GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards as set out in Annex II to the Standard Contractual Clauses. You and GitHub shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate:

- **B.** the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;  
- **C.** the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and, a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
