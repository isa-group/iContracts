# To answer the following questions we must simulate a real context. In this case, we consider a customer with an annual subscription, enjoys since January 1, 2024 of the provider's services and the total amount of the fees is 528$. When must the customer terminate the contract in order not to renew the license or subscription to the services?
## Background
The user question pertains to the termination of a contract to avoid the renewal of a license or subscription to services. The context provided indicates that the customer has an annual subscription with the service provider, which began on January 1, 2024, and the total fees amount to $528. To answer the question, we need to consider the terms of the agreement that govern the termination of the contract and the renewal of the subscription.

## Thoughts
- The relevant clauses to consider are 9.1, 9.2, and 1.2, which discuss the term of the agreement, termination without cause, and the duration of licenses, respectively.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Clause 9.2 states that either party may terminate the agreement without cause on 30 days' notice. This implies that the customer must give notice at least 30 days before the end of the subscription term to avoid automatic renewal.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- Clause 1.2 indicates that licenses expire at the end of the applicable Subscription Term unless renewed. This suggests that if the customer does not terminate the contract before the end of the Subscription Term, the license will be automatically renewed.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- To determine the exact date by which the customer must terminate the contract, we need to calculate 30 days prior to the end of the Subscription Term, which is December 31, 2024.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

- The customer should therefore give notice of termination by December 1, 2024, to ensure that the 30-day notice period is satisfied.
  - Flawed: False
  - Helpful: True

## Answer
- The customer must terminate the contract by December 1, 2024, to avoid renewing the license or subscription to the services.
  - Score: 10
