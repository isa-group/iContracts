## Document 1: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors
GitHub may hire Subprocessors to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to this engagement and to GitHub
Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by GitHub of the
processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under applicable law, the Standard Contractual Clauses or the GDPR Related Terms.  
GitHub is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with GitHub’s obligations in this DPA. GitHub makes available information about
Subprocessors on the GitHub website https://github.com/subprocessors (or a successor location). When engaging any Subprocessor, GitHub will
ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services GitHub has
retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. GitHub will ensure that Subprocessors
are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of GitHub by the DPA, including the
limitations on disclosure of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to oversee the Subprocessors to ensure that these contractual obligations are met.  
From time to time, GitHub may engage new Subprocessors. GitHub will give Customer notice (by updating the website at https://github.com/github-
subprocessors-list (or a successor location) and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor in
advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data. If GitHub engages a new Subprocessor for a new Online Service, GitHub will give Customer notice prior to availability of that Online Service.  
If Customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Service without penalty
by providing, before the end of the relevant notice period, written notice of termination. Customer may also include an explanation of the grounds
for non-approval together with the termination notice, in order to permit GitHub to re-evaluate any such new Subprocessor based on the applicable
concerns. If the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite.
After termination, GitHub will remove payment obligations for any subscriptions for the terminated Online Service from subsequent invoices to Customer or its reseller.

1. Data Security Certifications. Data importer holds the following data security certifications:
- SOC 1, Type 2;
- SOC 2, Type 2;
- NIST, to the extent incorporated for FedRAMP Low-Impact / Tailored ATO.
2. Personnel. Data importer’s personnel will not process personal data without authorization. Personnel are
obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any such personal data and this obligation continues even after

address:  
```

Vendor management program - third-party risk program The data importer has a vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection agreements with vendors. Vendors undergo reassessment when a new business use case is requested.
