## Document 0: GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Version May 2022) - DATA PROTECTION TERMS - Security Incident Notification
If GitHub becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or
access to Customer Data or Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in
connection with the Online Services (each a " **Security Incident** "), GitHub will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify Customer of the Security
Incident; (2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with detailed information about the Security Incident; (3) take reasonable steps
to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident.  
Notification(s) of Security Incidents will be delivered to one or more of Customer's administrators by any means GitHub selects, including via email.
It is Customer's sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information with GitHub and that Customer's administrators monitor for
and respond to any notifications. Customer is solely responsible for complying with its obligations under incident notification laws applicable to
Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Security Incident.  
GitHub will make reasonable efforts to assist Customer in fulfilling Customer's obligation under GDPR Article 33 or other applicable law or regulations to notify the relevant regulatory or supervisory authority and individual data subjects about a Security Incident.  
GitHub’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by GitHub of any fault or liability with respect
to the Security Incident.  
Customer must notify GitHub promptly about any possible misuse of its accounts or authentication credentials or any Security Incident related to an
Online Service.
